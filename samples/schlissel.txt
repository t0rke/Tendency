to all members of the campus community
i thank the students faculty and staff who have signed up for and received covid 19 tests through our community sampling & tracking program last week we conducted nearly 5800 on campus tests
following tuesdays announcement of a stay in place order for ann arbor campus undergraduates and new guidance on class formats we have posted details on the campus maize and blueprint site these include answers to frequently asked questions from the university and county as well as links to the order itself and our student departure testing and protocol information
its important to note that most of our campus activities remain the same during this stay in place order research and patient care continue graduate students continue in their studies in person classes continue where that format is essential many facilities remain open registration and voting are happening intercollegiate athletics are continuing and our democracy and debate theme semester is engaging our community around the democratic process we already have most people working from home and a large majority of courses already were being taught remotely
the risk of classroom transmission remains low the increasing covid 19 transmission we are seeing is not due to interactions in our classrooms and labs our new guidance for course formats makes it as simple as possible for undergraduate students to comply with the order provides choices for students and instructors and supports those students who may choose to leave ann arbor and finish their semester from home student life sent more detailed information to undergraduates on departure testing and protocols wednesday

to all members of the campus community
covid 19 cases are increasing on our campus and in the region state and nation as we noted last friday in our weekly briefing increases among students both on and off campus are heightening the pressure on our case investigators contact tracers and quarantine and isolation housing capacity
today the washtenaw county health department in collaboration with the university issued a 14 day stay in place order for our undergraduate students which goes into effect immediately we fully support this action as it enhances protections for our students and the welfare of our community we also are implementing steps beyond the order out of an abundance of caution and to provide choices for students and instructors including moving more of our undergraduate courses to fully remote instruction
we want to thank everyone who has been diligent in following public health guidelines and the many thousands of students and employees who have supported community health and safety your commitment to everyones safety will be an enormous help to our community for the rest of the semester and beyond the good work of so many will be crucial as we navigate the closing weeks of the semester
county stay in place order details
under the washtenaw county order u m undergraduate students living in on campus near campus or off campus housing in ann arbor will be required to stay in place and remain in their current designated residence the full set of restrictions is spelled out by the county here
the countys order is preventive as the document notes that covid 19 cases among 18 24 year old persons thus far in washtenaw county have not resulted in increased hospitalization or death rates additionally thus far the increased incidence in 18 24 year old persons has not been linked to increased incidence in other populations in washtenaw county additional preventive efforts are necessary to ensure that this remains so the order will be in place until at least nov 3
exceptions to the order include leaving a residence to attend class pick up food medication and other basic needs for medical appointments voting or volunteering as poll workers attending religious practice activities or obtaining covid 19 testing the order also specifies that undergraduate students can leave their residences for purposes of physical activity outdoors in groups of no more than two if appropriate preventive measures are followed
the order addresses social gatherings which have been identified as the main cause of recent covid 19 spread on campus in the surrounding community and the broader region most of the cases on our campus can be traced back to small  and medium size gatherings without appropriate face coverings and social distancing
the order is an important intervention to reduce the spread of the virus and it reflects the universitys close partnership with the county we have been coordinating on covid 19 since before the early days of the crisis todays order is in addition to the enhanced social distancing order for residents of mary markley hall issued last week
undergraduate course format and other changes
even though the risk of classroom transmission remains low  and the increasing covid 19 transmission we are seeing is not due to our classrooms and labs  we are issuing new guidelines for undergraduate course delivery to go into effect tomorrow and continue for the remainder of the semester for undergraduate students all classes that are substantially enhanced by in person instruction due to the nature of the instruction or space or equipment needs will continue to be taught in person most other undergraduate classes will be taught fully remotely
were taking this additional step to exercise an abundance of caution while also making it as simple as possible for undergraduate students to comply with the order provide choices for students and instructors and to support those students who may choose to leave ann arbor and finish their semester from home
each school or college will manage the process to enable exceptions for instructors who wish to continue teaching courses in person for instructional reasons instructors who will continue to teach in person are expected to notify their students
undergraduates will not be allowed to participate in in person research and scholarship however senior students engaged in in person research and scholarship for credit as part of a class or a thesis project can work with research leadership in their particular unit to request an exception undergraduates with campus jobs will still be able to go to work with the consent of their supervisors  under public health protocols
choices for leaving campus
with the shift to more remote instruction and the increased stress we know this kind of measure can add to an already challenging semester students may choose to return to their permanent homes depending on comfort levels and individual circumstances
the county health department order says that students who live in u m housing may only return to their permanent address if they follow u m testing and checkout procedures to be provided soon to lower the risk that they might carry disease home with them our procedures will include covid 19 testing which the university will provide for students who live in michigan housing or have dining plans and who wish to return to their permanent residence we are working out details to provide prorated room and board refunds or credits such refunds will be subject to potential financial aid implications that will need to be reviewed on a case by case basis
once a student returns home for safety reasons they will need to remain home
earlier this week in an effort to provide more covid 19 testing opportunities for michigan housing residents the university sent an email offering additional testing locations for the upcoming week of october 19 through its community sampling & tracking program
why these steps were taken
stay in place protocols and moving to increased remote instruction were amongst the potential mitigation strategies we shared earlier this semester  the response metrics that led us to this decision include increasing use of our isolation and quarantine housing more than 70 new cases per million in washtenaw county the markley cluster likely having more than 100 close contacts five days of sustained increases in cases and inability to perform prompt case investigation and contact tracing
wastewater testing has validated our mapping of covid 19 on campus were seeing the virus most prevalently in areas we expect  in our quarantine and isolation housing and in hill area residence halls which includes markley
to reduce transmission and assist our case investigators we urge everyone to please wear your face coverings rigorously maintain social distance reduce gathering sizes and comply with the county order for undergraduates complete daily symptom checks using responsiblue and be vigilant especially when you are indoors it is of crucial importance that everyone respond and cooperate honestly and fully with contact tracers as well we need the best and most accurate and timely information to be able to optimally target interventions  and avoid broader restrictions  this call for cooperation is also part of the countys action today
additional information on todays changes
well post any additional changes due to the order on the campus maize and blueprint site but we want to emphasize that many of our activities will not change
most on campus services including our libraries will continue as they have during this semester though with increased remote modalities the michigan union will remain open for many services as well
the county order exempts intercollegiate athletics so long as practices and competitions occur under medical supervision and regular virus tests are conducted by the big ten according to its approved protocols there has not been documented transmission of covid 19 among student athletes in our athletics facilities u m supports the leagues testing program and the staff of the athletic department are committed to protocols that protect the health of our student athletes
campus staff will continue their work under the guidelines that have been in place all who can work remotely must continue to do so
we know the increase in cases is causing a lot of stress in our community please take advantage of the mental health and well being resources we have in places for students campus faculty and staff and michigan medicine employees
more information will be coming soon from student life and your schools colleges and departments to share further details and address questions we are moving up the regular campus covid 19 weekly briefing from friday to this evening at 5 pm an updated invitation will be sent later today well also post the video from the briefing here when it is ready
we want to thank the members of the covid 19 campus health response committee for the tremendous work that informed these changes from the start our plans were designed to be flexible and adaptive based on campus conditions
we also appreciate everyone in our community who has shared their thoughts and concerns with us your commitment to our community and patience as we address the covid 19 pandemic continues to be essential for our success working together we will bring our fall semester to a successful conclusion in december plans for the winter 2021 semester will be announced in early november
to all members of the campus community
i want to thank everyone who has signed up for asymptomatic testing through our community sampling & tracking program and urge everyone on campus to participate this is an important tool we use to monitor covid 19 and we have capacity that is going unused
there has been a troubling increase in covid 19 activity across the region and around the state and nation with new cases often attributed to social gatherings both indoors and outside as noted below we are also experiencing a significant increase in cases amongst those in our residence halls we are entering a critical phase in our effort to control the pandemic in our university community
our transition to saliva testing through our lynxdx partnership now in its first full week has doubled our asymptomatic testing capacity and made it easier to take a test we have opened an additional cstp testing location on north campus at pierpont commons  in addition to the one weve had at palmer commons on central campus this week we also began rotating on site testing at residence halls schedule available here
after positive cases and close contacts were moved to isolation and quarantine related to last weeks cluster of positive cases in mary markley our additional testing identified 12 cases on the third floor of the residence hall
together with the washtenaw county health department our public health experts have recommended 14 days of enhanced social distancing for residents on the third floor of markley and asked them not to attend in person classes we have used enhanced social distancing in certain residence hall responses to separate asymptomatic and healthy individuals from possible exposure this includes monitoring your health reducing contact with others and following public health guidance as noted in the previous link at this time our case investigation has found no evidence of additional clusters within the building as a further precaution university health service has provided mandatory pop up testing for the remaining markley residents who were not previously tested in the past 14 days
the additional testing is an example of how we are deploying testing in response to conditions on our campus i encourage both students living on campus and off who think they may be infected to get tested for the virus through our university health service its fast convenient and easy and the results come back more quickly allowing us to more effectively intervene to prevent spread of the pandemic testing does not prevent infection however so its vitally important to remember to keep groups small practice social distancing and wear your face coverings
campus weekly covid 19 briefing
the video for this weeks campus weekly covid 19 briefing is available here we are continuing to post videos of previous briefings and answers to some of the questions we werent able to get to here
at todays briefing chief health officer malani discussed the testing options we have on campus after the additions and expansion of the past few weeks and dean of students laura blake jones summarized updates to our wolverine culture of care campaign
our culture of care takes on additional importance with the return of football and halloween on the horizon

i spoke about our covid in the classroom chart and the new covid 19 hotline 734 936 7000
dr malani has shared some additional details about our campus in her video message today
overall case counts have been lower this week compared with recent weeks at both the campus and county level we identified some small clusters in residence halls but none of the clusters has had more than 100 close contacts nor have we exceeded capacity for contact tracing determined in collaboration with washtenaw county health officials
all positive cases and known close contacts were isolated or quarantined additionally we conducted broader pop up asymptomatic testing in several residence halls as a precaution for mary markley south quad and west quad this included offering tests to more than 700 residents
several large off campus houses were under quarantine as a targeted response as well following consultation with our department of environment health & safety and the county health department we also offered broader asymptomatic testing of individuals living in those settings an ongoing review of the situation is being conducted by campus and county public health officials to determine what additional mitigation strategies may be considered
saliva testing expansion
our community sampling and tracking program is switching to a saliva based collection method for u m surveillance testing at the same time were streamlining the sign up process expanding campus testing locations and increasing capacity for testing of students faculty and staff on the ann arbor campus
i urge everyone on campus to sign up for this program currently we are testing about 1200 individual volunteers per week with this program despite having the capacity to test more than twice that number the change to saliva based collection will further increase capacity to 6000 per week by the end of month  but you must sign up to be tested under this program more details on this important change are available in the university record
additional updates
the michigan department of health and human services and the washtenaw county health department announced emergency measures monday to keep covid 19 prevention and control strategies in place after a michigan supreme court ruling last week created uncertainty for gov gretchen whitmers executive orders the measures include wearing face coverings limiting gathering sizes and mandatory daily health screenings of employees u m and the county have existing measures in place for these orders additional details are available in the university record
a reminder that although the university of michigan is currently under spending hiring restrictions these measures do not apply to the spending of federal or sponsored funds including hiring for the purpose of completing the aims of a sponsored project faculty are encouraged to work with their schools and departments to process hiring and equipment spending on their externally funded grants
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to help keep everyone informed and address concerns and respond to feedback and questions from our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates
to all members of the campus community
now that we are a month into the semester university of michigan chief health officer and michigan parent preeti malani reports that cases have been increasing the last two weeks and shares updates on our campus and how we can prevent the spread of covid 19 her video is here and im sharing additional details and information below
in response to suggestions from the community our covid 19 dashboard now includes positive u m cases reported by off campus sources though weve always tracked total cases in conjunction with the washtenaw county health department we want our dashboard to reflect campus community conditions as accurately as possible
the university record has additional information about our recent dashboard improvements
also these numbers are adjusted after initial posting as we learn more about the onset of cases and as additional results are reported from outside labs our dashboard presents data from multiple u m county and state sources the full explanation is here we continue to work in close partnership with the health department to provide data and keep the community safe
i want to emphasize again the importance of students being tested at uhs especially in light of the numbers of positive cases that we are seeing identified by off campus testing
the benefits of having the test completed at uhs rather than an outside facility include the rapid turnaround time for results thanks to lab staff at michigan medicine use of the most accurate test available pcr and that we can begin case investigation and contact tracing more quickly diminishing spread of covid 19 the health department shares positive and probable cases from outside tests involving michigan students however those extra steps introduce a delay information and videos by our campus experts on this topic are available here
students isolated with a positive test or those instructed to quarantine due to an exposure are not necessarily required to do so on north campus sometimes this can happen at a current residence or permanent home depending on the nature of those living arrangements in addition we have worked hard to improve the quality of u m isolation and quarantine housing and have made significant progress
as part of our efforts to address your concerns and provide information more clearly we also have changed our campus maize and blueprint site to feature a section called top frequently asked questions on the sites front page these are questions we are hearing frequently and we want to make it easier for everyone to access the information
our environment health and safety department and the county health department are addressing about 25 recent positive cases arising in student off campus congregate living residences student life is offering information and support as well
south quad pop up testing
our university health service uhs in collaboration with campus partners quickly addressed the cluster in south quad that was identified and reported last week teams implemented our existing public health and safety measures that included quarantine isolation case investigation disinfection and public notices
additionally they created a pop up site to test all students residing on two specific floors of south quad  as of monday the 221 test results received all came back negative indicating that the infection had not spread beyond the initial groups of students
these additional students were tested out of an abundance of caution as none of them were identified as close contacts and none were experiencing covid 19 symptoms
weve posted more details online this includes a michigan minds podcast with lindsey mortenson acting uhs director who further describes this testing effort i join dr mortenson in thanking the students who stepped up to be tested in this important health and safety effort collaboratively implemented by uhs our school of public health and u m housing
additional updates
the office of the vice president for research has organized a committee to address inequities induced or exacerbated by covid 19 across the research community led by professors tabbye chavous and huda akil the committee will partner with colleagues from across our three campuses to reduce these negative impacts on researchers scholarly progress productivity and opportunity to thrive and help support an equitable diverse and robust research environment vice president for research rebecca cunningham will share more information about this committee with the university community in the coming weeks
the u m library has expanded its by reservation study hours in the shapiro library and borrowing services and contactless pickup at multiple locations more information is available in the university record and the library has full details on its site
autumn has begun and the days are starting to become cooler please make every effort to follow the rules around wearing a face covering avoiding crowds keeping the proper distance and washing your hands more frequently as socializing moves indoors  you can enjoy yourself stay healthy and protect others you care about by being smart about covid 19 risk
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to help keep everyone informed address concerns and respond to feedback and questions from our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates
to all members of the campus community
faculty students and staff continue to share their concerns about the need for greater testing resources more detailed and timely information about cases in our university community and other ways to help them stay safe were working hard to put these ideas into action
this weeks update contains information in all of these areas and important changes to our ambassador program based on feedback
the campus covid 19 dashboard now displays case numbers listed by residence hall we will update this data weekly upon verification by the state of michigans disease surveillance system we have also added to the dashboard a new section with data on surveillance testing these changes follow community requests for more detailed information
it is very important that u m students who feel ill or are concerned about possibly contracting covid 19 get their testing done through uhs its fast and easy we do get reports from the county health department about u m students testing positive at off campus facilities but this slows down the essential steps of case investigation and contact tracing that can help prevent spread to others
south quad update
as of yesterday there have been 19 confirmed positive cases in our south quad residence hall u ms environment health and safety department and the washtenaw county health department have identified this as a cluster
after extensive investigation the majority of the cases were found to be connected but three cases are not associated and have no known source of exposure while this can happen at any time during a pandemic situation we are taking additional measures to prevent the spread of covid 19 within the building all positive cases and close contacts have been moved to isolation or quarantine and all residents of the involved floors are being tested more information has been posted to the public health community notices section of our dashboard
expanded surveillance testing
we have entered into an agreement to begin offering saliva based covid 19 diagnostic surveillance testing on the ann arbor campus this new type of testing will begin early next month and allow the university to increase surveillance testing capacity to up to 6000 individuals per week through the voluntary u m covid 19 community sampling and tracking program
please sign up for this free covid 19 testing program using the link in the previous sentence so far more than 5700 students faculty and staff have volunteered and more than half are students who live off campus
the company providing the testing services under the new agreement is lynxdx a startup spun off of intellectual property developed on our campus
public health community notifications
we have heard a number of questions related to the public health community notifications that we post to make the community aware that there were people who tested positive for coronavirus in a particular u m building during their infectious period we recently began posting these notices in a section on our public dashboard the notices are posted as soon as they are available
when a u m student staff or faculty member tests positive for covid 19 a dedicated team of staff case investigators and contact tracers  working within u ms environment health & safety department  take steps to prevent the spread of the disease by isolating infected individuals and quarantining those who have been exposed to the virus and are at risk of developing covid 19
ehs leads contact tracing and issues notifications on campus because of staff familiarity with the campus community ability to act swiftly to identify and contact individuals and because of the departments years of experience handling infectious disease outbreaks
it is critically important that all community members make themselves available to speak with these staff if they reach out to contact you this is an important part of our efforts to prevent the spread of infection
ehs works in partnership with the washtenaw county health department as well
this is described in greater detail here
wolverine culture of cares new phase
in response to broad feedback from student organizations and campus groups and the need to continually evolve amid the changing conditions of the pandemic the wolverine culture of care initiative is refocusing its health and safety efforts
the universitys covid reporting line 734 647 3000 and voluntary address and phone registry for students living off campus will remain important components of our community health and safety efforts our division of student life set up the voluntary registry to promote outreach that reduces the need for law enforcement interventions this has been working well and i invite all students living off campus to sign up
the initiative changes also include discontinuing the use of students faculty and staff to canvas surrounding campus neighborhoods through the michigan ambassador program
while the universitys division of public safety and security and the ann arbor police department will maintain their regular on and near campus area work non emergency calls into the covid reporting line will continue to be answered by student life staff and volunteers and if no contact information is available for a reported address dpss staff will attempt to reach the residents prior to the involvement of aapd
additional information on changes to the wolverine culture of care program is available here
big ten announcement
earlier this week the big ten announced plans and safety protocols that will allow us to resume fall sports including football
when the league decided early last month to postpone fall sports it was because our medical experts were not confident in the ability to prevent coronavirus transmission during full practices and competitions especially in contact sports in addition there was deep concern about reports and preliminary investigations of myocarditis inflammation of the heart in people recovering from covid 19 it was feared that the combination of intense exercise and myocarditis could be particularly dangerous for our student athletes
in the intervening weeks a task force worked out procedures including the use of a newly available fda approved daily viral antigen test that could assure that the playing fields and practice facilities were free of virus and a protocol for cardiac evaluation that would screen for myocarditis and other potential heart issues before allowing a recovering student to return to practice or competition testing will be paid for by the league and this will not affect testing capacity on our campus we are relying on daily testing for student athletes since their sport does not allow them to use methods to prevent the spread of disease available to everyone else masks social distancing and the avoidance of interacting with large groups of people
additional updates
our responsiblue health screening tool is now available as a free app for android and apple devices the self screens continue to be an important layer in our health and safety plans in addition to daily use of the new app i continue to urge everyone to follow our rules requiring that you wear face coverings when on campus
to date u m researchers on all three of our campuses have submitted more than 800 proposals to pursue covid related research launched more than 320 covid related research projects and authored more than 600 covid related publications advancing our knowledge of the virus and its impacts on our communities
two u m researchers tested positive for covid 19 this week bringing the total cases among researchers since march to nine ehs is managing contact tracing to protect the health and safety of our research community and at this time there is no indication of any virus transmission between laboratory or research coworkers
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to help keep everyone informed and address concerns and respond to feedback and questions from our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates

during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates we have modified the design of the maize and blueprint site based on community feedback to make it easier to access the latest information and weve added a new public health notices page to proactively make the u m community aware of positive cases on campus and potential exposures
our case numbers remain low  and currently are lower than many other campuses who have different mixes of remote and in person instruction this is the result of excellent diligence from many in our community thank you for going above and beyond to help keep everyone safe
current data from the week beginning aug 30 as our semester was getting underway show 19 new cases 12 students 7 non students as our data dashboard notes non student cases include remote employees and exposures outside of campus
it is important that students who get tested privately off campus notify the university health service of their test results to assist in our ongoing assessment of covid 19 spread in the university community weve also created graphics to help students living on and off campus know what to do in various covid 19 related scenarios
although our lower case numbers are good the number of contacts per case continues to be high this is very much a concern we urge everyone to continue to practice social distancing and limit gathering sizes to help prevent further spread of covid 19 we have to maintain our vigilance to keep case numbers low
helping us with contact tracing for positive cases is our new contact tracing corps which we announced last week
we have also been hearing that some individuals who are positive are reluctant to disclose all of their contacts so as not to get them in trouble please be forthcoming with our contact tracers being able to reach everyone who may have an exposure is essential to our efforts to control spread and accurately assess risk in our community
responsiblue self screening tool
use of our responsiblue self screening tool has grown especially among students i thank everyone who is using this tool to self monitor their health usage is up about 25 percent since residence hall move in for students faculty staff and visitors
as a reminder each day all members of our campus community who enter campus buildings and facilities are required to check themselves for covid 19 symptoms by answering a brief set of questions using responsiblue the tool offers advice on where to seek care if you are not well and provides insights and visibility to the state of public health at u m
self screening was a key element of the safe ramp up of our research operations
voluntary surveillance testing program
testing has begun this week for our voluntary covid 19 community sampling and tracking program so far more than 4800 u m community members have signed up we continue to seek volunteers especially among students who live in on campus housing to fulfill our initial goal of 3000 tests per week we are examining ways to further increase this capacity surveillance testing suggested by many in our community is just one part of our multi tier testing and monitoring approach to help us limit the spread of covid 19
get your flu shot
i encourage everyone to get a flu shot as soon as possible the flu vaccine is important for individual and community health but its also an important tool in our plans to combat the pandemic because the symptoms of flu are very similar to covid 19 fewer cases of the flu will help us devote testing and other coronavirus resources to those who need them most
ill be getting my flu shot on monday
the university health service now has the flu vaccine for u m students there is no out of pocket expense this year your health insurance will be billed and any cost not covered by your insurance will be covered by the university
the university record shared information from mhealthy on flu vaccinations for employees
additional updates
we have heard a number of requests for more information about the metrics we are using to monitor conditions on our campus and adjust our plans these include considerations such as the rate of growth in the number of covid 19 cases and clusters the percentage of positive tests for the virus our capacity for case investigation and contact tracing quarantine capacity the level of covid 19 in ann arbor and washtenaw county and the capacity of michigan medicine the covid 19 campus health response committee is working to formalize these metrics and provide greater details and well share more as soon as we can well also be posting more detailed information on frequent questions from our community i know that there remains a great demand for different types of information
we have posted information on the universitys proposal to the graduate employees organization to end the strike the proposal was supported by geo leadership but rejected by a membership vote please see the message sent to campus earlier today from the provost and me for more thoughts on this situation and our challenges as a community
i again thank everyone for their hard work and diligence as the semester continues our progress thus far is because you care so deeply about your classmates colleagues and fellow community members
dear students
i hope you and your loved ones are having a safe healthy and enjoyable summer at the university of michigan we have spent the last few months preparing diligently to welcome you and begin another academic year
the weeks leading up to the start of school are always filled with excitement and some anxiety and the covid 19 pandemic has certainly added to everyone's worries
i am writing today to share a few of the ways we are working to create a safe and healthy living and learning environment on our campus  and to ask for your help the pandemic is growing worse in many parts of our nation and it will take our collective commitment to have a successful academic year
the most important measures we can all take are described in the video above
wear a mask when you're outside your home
wash your hands more frequently
avoid crowded places especially indoors but also outdoor gatherings
these are health and safety measures that are based on research and they will help to protect you and your fellow students as well as your roommates professors family members and everyone in our communities further recommendations and developments will be posted to our campus maize and blueprint site
vice president for student life martino harmon and university health service executive director rob ernst shared additional information with you on monday and i want to emphasize it here we want to be sure that you feel free to decide the best option for you this year
courses
we are finalizing our course selection website with information on formats  in person hybrid or fully remote  to help you choose which classes you want to take about 70 percent of credit hours for undergraduates will be taken fully remotely this fall among those currently registered with many hybrid courses offering the option to attend remotely as well final course format information will be posted august 7
please review your course selections with the class formats in mind as you decide whether to come to ann arbor or study remotely from home this semester
we realize that many majors require courses that can only be effective in person and we're committed to offering those we also know that our new international students need to take some in person or hybrid classes because of federal guidelines
if all the courses you need are available remotely however you may choose to remain at home and pursue your studies this fall this is especially true if you or your family have risk factors that make covid 19 more dangerous
you will receive a high quality education and continue progress towards your michigan degree regardless of the class formats you choose your professors have been hard at work to ensure that the education we offer remains world class also many of the services provided by student life such as counseling and psychological services and student advising will be available remotely
students who have already signed housing contracts will be allowed to cancel without penalty until august 14 we will amend our usual rules and allow students with housing contracts who study remotely in the fall semester to apply for housing in the winter semester and we will make every effort to accommodate all requests
health and safety updates
if you do choose to come back to ann arbor we have made numerous preparations to keep you as safe as possible but as i said above you will have to be committed to do your part
all us students coming to ann arbor will need to practice enhanced social distancing during the 14 days before arriving during these two weeks monitor your health reduce your contact with others and follow the guidance shared by vice president harmon and dr ernst the 14 day period will begin upon arrival for students arriving from international destinations students coming from some us locations with high incidence of covid 19 may need to practice additional distancing upon arrival as well we will track this information and let you know which locations may have additional distancing requirements before your arrival in ann arbor
we'll also ask you to complete an online learning module that includes important information on covid 19
students moving into u m housing's residence halls and apartments are expected to be tested for the virus that causes covid 19 and be cleared before arriving in ann arbor u m is partnering with quest diagnostics to provide testing kits at no additional cost directly to on campus housing students to self administer and then mail back to quest for analysis
if you are planning to live in u m housing you will receive an email this week with additional information and instructions on testing students living in our munger graduate residences had an earlier move in and they are being tested after arrival
if you choose to come to campus you can expect to see a carefully crafted response to how we handle suspected or positive cases of covid 19 this includes
we'll offer students virus testing when indicated and care through our university health service
we'll continue to work closely with local public health officials to perform contact tracing for all infected students and employees as we have throughout the pandemic
we'll support and provide living space for any student who develops symptoms or tests positive and needs to quarantine or isolate safely this includes meal delivery
we have created an online tool so members of our community can check any symptoms daily the tool also offers advice on seeking care we're modifying the tool for students and it will be available later this month
we are working on a plan to perform surveillance testing of students in residence halls
wolverine culture of care
the first weeks after you arrive are pivotal to our shared health and success as well
as i've previously noted u m is requiring all students staff faculty and visitors to wear a face covering that covers the mouth and nose while anywhere on campus grounds this includes when inside buildings outdoors and on u m transportation on all of our campuses it is difficult on a busy university campus to maintain distance from groups even while outdoors so requiring face coverings outdoors will help slow the spread of the virus one exception is when you're in your own room or residence
the research is clear that wearing a face covering is one of the most effective tools we have for preventing the spread of covid 19 and saving lives
our division of student life worked closely with u m students across campus this summer to develop the wolverine culture of care  a commitment to keeping the u m campus community as healthy and safe as possible we encourage you to review and post these guidelines as a reminder on how to best care for yourself and to be respectful of your shared responsibility for the health of others
this is crucial not just for you and your friends and family members but for the thousands of people who live in ann arbor or work on our campus across the country and here in michigan we've seen how one gathering or party can cause an outbreak each incident places additional demands on our health care professionals contact tracers and staff across the university city and county
thank you for choosing u m
i want to express my appreciation and admiration to all of you you've chosen to study at a premier public research university in one of higher education's most dynamic academic environments
i know that we are asking you to take on responsibilities that go above and beyond what was expected several months ago wear a facing covering avoid gatherings connect with friends and loved ones remotely take some or all classes online
but you chose michigan because you knew you were ready for a challenge we now hope you will extend that enthusiasm to meet a challenge not only from your academics but from a world that has changed  and a world that you can help to ensure will change for the better bolstered by your university of michigan education
throughout the many difficulties of the pandemic i've been amazed by the incredible resilience and talents of you our students world class education during a pandemic is no small feat it's hard and rarely as smooth as we would like this is true for us as teachers and you as learners
for months you've shared with us your resilience your innovative ideas for how to make our university safer and your outstanding commitment to a university that aspires to create a better world for all
thank you all so much stay safe and healthy see you soon
to all members of the university community
i am writing today to share the good news that our state has entered a new stage in our recovery from the covid 19 pandemic gov gretchen whitmer announced monday that she has rescinded the stay home stay safe order for all parts of our state and we are transitioning to the improving phase of the mi safe start plan
i know many of you have questions about how this affects our campuses employees and students for now much of what we are doing on our campuses will not change but cautious reactivation of various in person activities will continue with additional details provided below
our ability to feel positive however is diminished by the tragic deaths of george floyd ahmaud arbery and breonna taylor that represent a different kind of pandemic  racism that continues to plague our communities earlier today i sent a message to our community inviting everyone to a virtual student town hall planned for friday at noon to attempt to promote healing and examine these essential issues
i again want to thank everyone in the u m community who has spoken out advanced peaceful protest offered support and sent the message that we wont tolerate any form of racism or vile acts that end the lives of our fellow human beings
u ms next steps in the covid 19 recovery
gov whitmers announcement monday demonstrates that together we are gaining the upper hand in our work to reduce the spread of covid 19 social distancing and stepped up hygiene practices are working
i applaud the experts from our school of public health and other parts of our campuses who have helped to inform decisions at the state and campus levels all of michigan is in a better place thanks to the scientific understanding professionalism and dedication of many members of our community
i want to emphasize that public health guidelines will remain in place for many operations even as we continue our gradual reactivation we need to ask you to help us implement and follow these guidelines and consider next steps as conditions improve just like we came together to flatten the curve
if you can work from home please continue to do so working from home when possible follows the governors ongoing guidance as well as the recommendations of our own public health and medical professionals this remains crucial to our efforts to keep density low on campus to prevent a second wave of infection from affecting us our colleagues and loved ones please do not come into work on campus unless directed by your supervisor if conditions allow more in person work to occur in the weeks ahead we will share that information
research labs will continue their gradual ramp up our office of researchs careful deliberate plan for the orderly and gradual resumption of research is working well and will continue this is the result of extraordinary collaboration among many units including our schools and colleges facilities and operations our division of public safety and security and information and technology services i know that other units are using this work as a template for their own preparations
fall planning will continue our schools colleges and departments will continue to engage in their thorough planning for the fall semester we will announce details later this month many dozens of individuals are engaged in these efforts across our university and i thank them for their considerable efforts i remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to deliver a public health informed fall semester on our three campuses safely and with as much in person instruction as possible
social distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces remain essential this component of the governors guidance has not changed we also continue to urge everyone to follow smart hygiene practices such as hand washing and please continue to monitor any symptoms you may have and stay home if youre sick
employees already working on campus may continue to do so faculty and staff in some units have been working in person following public health guidelines this will continue as well
plans for museums and libraries will be shared soon the new executive order permits the opening of museums and libraries on june 8 with public health precautions were working on what this specifically will look like on our campuses and will share details including when we will open these resources as soon as we can
the governors announcement also permits outdoor social gatherings and events of up to 100 people with everyone maintaining six feet of distance indoor gatherings and events continue to be limited to 10 or fewer however additionally some restrictions on retail and dining in are being relaxed
i know that after such a long period of being asked to stay home the temptation is strong to return to normal activities i urge everyone to follow social distancing guidelines when going out our continued success and improvement in controlling this pandemic depend on all of us we will share more information on how these and other changes will affect our campus operations  but for now the bulleted items above remain in place for our uniaversity
all of you have my most sincere gratitude for your help in saving lives while continuing to fulfill the mission of the university during this pandemic i look forward to the day when we can all be together again
