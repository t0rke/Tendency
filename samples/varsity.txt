good morning
hopefully everyone is having a wonderful start to their week i'm reaching out yet again with some more leasing updates
i want to first thank you all for being so patient and understanding as we try to navigate leasing during covid 19 it is definitely a challenge to keep everyone safe while also continuing to rent apartments and you have been so kind and accommodating
on that note we have been totally flooded with rental inquiries for 2021 2022 we anticipated that leasing might be slower this year due to covid 19 but that doesn't appear to be the case with this happening we're making adjustments to our leasing plans this year we will ideally be able to offer prospective tenants the options of in person tours or zoom meetings to watch videos you have sent you can choose from the options below for what feels most comfortable and safe for you and your roommates
1 you can elect to prohibit in person touring of your house or apartment we absolutely understand if this is the case per previous emails we do need a video and pictures of your apartment house for this option to be chosen please turn those into leasing@varsitymanagementcom by october 19th at the latest
2 you can allow in person touring of your house or apartment you will find detailed in the next section our plans for making this as safe as possible if you choose this option we would still like a video and pictures of your apartment house by october 19th this will help us limit the amount of tours that occur as well as allow us to offer options to prospective tenants if they don't feel safe touring in person
if you choose to allow in person tours here are the measures we're taking to promote safety and wellness of residents staff and prospective tenants
all people present for the tour will be wearing a mask gloves and shoe covers
one leasing agent will conduct the tour and one of the prospective tenants will be allowed to attend the tour there will not be more than two people at a time on a tour of your apartment
screening questions will be emailed to the prospective tenants before their tour and any answers that indicate a potential illness will result in cancellation or rescheduling of the tour
you can decide at anytime to change your mind and opt out of in person tours we just need 24 hours notice for this
we also ask that if you will be home that you're wearing a mask while the tour is happening please also notify us of any illness symptoms so we can cancel or reschedule the tour
if we don't receive a response from you or your roommates we will assume that you're okay with us conducting in person tours also note if you didn't renew last year or already confirm that you won't be renewing for 2021 2022 these tours will not begin until november 6th 2020
thank you for taking the time to read this and have a great tuesday
hopefully you all had a wonderful weekend and a great monday morning so far
we're getting leasing started much earlier this year than previous years because we will be doing things a bit differently
first if you already know you would like to renew or transfer please let us know you can complete the attached renewal application and we can get your paperwork going right away if you're not sure yet no worries you have first dibs on your home until november 6th if you know you won't be renewing please inform us as soon as possible so we can begin advertising your unit
in an effort to keep you prospective tenants and staff safe from covid 19 we will not be conducting in person tours this year for the 2021 2022 leasing season we will instead be offering zoom meetings during which we will show videos and pictures of the units and answer questions
to make this happen we need videos and pictures of your apartments houses you have two options for this
1 someone on your lease can send us a video and pictures of your home for us to use for zoom tours
if you choose this option
please have whoever has the newest phone in your group take pictures we would love for each room to be photographed from multiple angles
please try to shoot the video in portrait orientation before you start the video turn on all of the lights close toilet lids and close cabinet doors
during videos you can narrate if you want but you can also just be silent try to avoid showing people in the video and move slowly it is nice to see the inside of closets and some details like that if possible if you can start outside the front door of the building and go all the way into your apartment house that would be great please make sure to show any porches basements and the parking area if possible
2 we will notify you of a time for a varsity management representative to come over to take a video and pictures
if you choose this option
  the apartment will need to be vacated for the fifteen minute time slot of the appointment
  please notify us if you or a roommate has been sick so we can make different arrangements
the sooner you can get us these videos and pictures the better leasing begins on november 6th 2020 so that will be the deadline for you to send us content before we begin scheduling our own visits
some of you may have already sent us videos and pictures from last year please check in if this applies to you and we will let you know if we need anything additional
thank you for your understanding this seems like a lot but it should actually be much less intrusive than normal leasing seasons let me know if you have any questions
