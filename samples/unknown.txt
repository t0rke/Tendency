dear students
as many of you have heard vice president for student life royster harper has announced her plans to retire january 17 2020 after an amazing four decades of service to the university of michigan and generations of students
dr harper’s impact is extraordinary as far as i’m concerned she has set the standard for student life leaders in our nation throughout her career including 18 years as vice president dr harper has worked tirelessly to enrich the lives of students from their academic and career aspirations to their health and growth as individuals she is passionate about helping all those around her reach their potential
i am among the many who consider her a world class mentor collaborator leader and person during the five years i have known her i’ve been continually impressed by her thoughtful and innovative leadership on important issues in particular she has spent all of her time at u m working to improve the student experience particularly for those who are underrepresented and she has led groundbreaking sexual misconduct prevention efforts and empowered survivors to report recover and seek justice
i will very much miss her friendship candor and steadfast advocacy for what is right for our students in the weeks to come we will develop plans to celebrate her outstanding service she and i will also collaborate to ensure a smooth transition and we will have more to share soon about a process to identify new leadership in student life for now we can assure everyone that students will be directly involved in the search process
i offer my deepest congratulations to dr harper and my utmost thanks for her service
