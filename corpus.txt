dear lsa students
by now you have likely seen the news from the washtenaw county health department and university administration regarding new requirements related to covid 19 the county has issued a new two week stay in place order for all university of michigan undergraduates enrolled in fall 2020 courses on the ann arbor campus who are living in on campus near campus or off campus housing i recognize the news is a lot to process especially given the concerted efforts that thousands of you have put in to follow public health guidelines and keep our community safe over the first weeks of the semester but the numbers are trending in the wrong direction on campus and in the larger community and we need to take these preventive steps to reduce the spread of the virus
there is a lot of information to digest in the messages from the county and administration but were in this together and well get through this latest challenge here is a quick summary of key things to know right now
starting tomorrow wednesday october 21 nearly all lsa classes will move to a remote format for the remainder of the semester there may be a few exceptions for courses that have compelling instructional reasons for staying in person until the thanksgiving recess your instructor will reach out to let you know if that is the case otherwise you should assume your classes are fully remote
the county order states you should generally remain in your housing except if you need to
attend in person classes
pick up food and other basic necessities including medication
obtain health care including covid testing
attend work with the approval of your employer
vote and take part in election activities at polling places
participate in religious services and activities
participate in physical activity outdoors in groups of no more than two
some lsa study spaces including some rooms you can reserve will remain open for you to take remote classes well be back in touch with those details in the next couple of days in order for us to keep these spaces open we need everyone to continue following all public health requirements including wearing face coverings and spatial distancing
starting tomorrow in person undergraduate laboratory research activity is temporarily paused with the exception of senior students engaged in research for credit or as a thesis project the university hopes to unpause undergraduate research at the end of the stay in place order
i realize you may have questions and concerns and were here to help you can also find information about university level topics such as tuition and housing on this website for questions about lsa and your classes you can talk to your instructor or department or email our hotline at lsa covid help@umichedu we want to hear from you and make sure you have what you need to succeed this semester a real person will get back to you quickly and well connect you to the information and resources you need
this is without a doubt a time when we are being asked to dig deep for some extra grit and it is a time to remember that everyone needs support to thrive please take good care of yourselves and one another and know that were here to support you at every step

dear lsa undergraduate students
as you probably know and as the provost emailed you about yesterday the graduate employees organization geo at the university of michigan began a strike as a result many gsis and other graduate employees have canceled course sections and other work many of you have had classes canceled i recognize that this is very disruptive especially during the second week of the semester as you figure out whether your classes are meeting how youll get your work done how you personally feel about the strike and perhaps whether you feel comfortable crossing a picket line to go to a class or a study space or a lab i am sorry
discussions on a number of matters are proceeding between geo and the provosts office and i very much hope that there will be a successful resolution very soon in the meantime we are moving as quickly as we can in lsa to provide continuous instruction in your courses given the sheer size of the college however we wont be able to fully cover all classes this week if you have questions or concerns about particular courses please contact the appropriate department directly please also be sure to reach out to your academic advisors for helpthere is a whole team here to support you
the lsa deans office has stated our expectation that all instructors will continue to fulfill their teaching responsibilities this week the strike violates the terms of the contract geo signed last spring geo agreed by contract not to take actions that interfere with the universitys operations which includes your education geo has raised many important concerns including ones we know many of you care deeply about as well most of these issues however are beyond the scope of their contract
one concern geo raised and which some of you have asked about is the safety of instructors amid the pandemic lsa is committed to the safety of all instructors as well as students and we know of no lsa instructorfaculty or gsiwho has been required to teach in person against their preferences or needs this has been very important to us
graduate students do vital work at the university and in lsa almost all of you have worked withor will work withgsis in your time as an lsa student and i know those connections can be very meaningful and even life changing parts of your education we in lsa feel very fortunate to work with some of the best graduate students in the country and we are grateful for everything they contribute to our excellence as a college
i sincerely hope that geo and the provosts office are able to resolve these disputes quickly knowing that all of us are eager to return to classes as soon as possible we are deeply committed to your education and we appreciate your patience as we respond to this very difficult situation
please know that you are welcome to reach out to me anytime

closing thoughts
i hope you find this information helpful i knowand still vividly remember from my own college experiencethat starting up or starting back to college can be both exciting and stressful and this years circumstances may intensify those emotions please know that we are committed to your success and well being as part of one of the greatest living and learning liberal arts communities in the world we firmly believe that everyone needs support to thrive and we have many support systems here physically and virtually just for you as the semester gets even closer ill be back in touch with a detailed reminder about those resources so you have the information at your fingertips when you start classes whether you are on campus or in your kitchen the courses you take the people you meet virtually or on campus and the things you experience will be life changing and we want each of you to thrive absolutely as much as possible this year
dear lsa students
i am writing to follow up on the news from president schlissel that the university of michigan will have an in person public health informed fall semester as the dean of the college of literature science and the arts and as a faculty member co teaching an undergraduate course called epic grammar fails this fall i am really looking forward to having the opportunity to engage with you in person and online there is an irrepressible and irreplaceable energy that you as students bring to campus and it inspires me every year
and while there is uncertainty ahead i want to start with a pledge and a certainty the pledge is to make your health and safety our first priority always the certainty is in the power and lasting relevance of lsas liberal arts and sciences education i truly believe that a liberal arts education has never been more important or more valuable than it is now we reimagine the world here in lsa and we can do that better because you are here in our community with all the diverse perspectives you bring we push the boundaries of whats understood about human experience and the natural world taking up the existential challenges of climate change systemic racism the biology of viruses and more we pursue these questions with rigor and empathy knowing that no one person or field of study has all the solutions and through research and learning we cultivate skills and mindsets that are fundamental to making purposeful positive change in the world
as the president mentioned the university is a big place and many practices need to be determined by individual schools and colleges like lsa i want to share some initial information about particular steps lsa will be taking with more details to follow in the weeks ahead
first i want to acknowledge that while we know a good deal about what the fall will look like there is much we dont yet know the university is still determining for example how regular virus screening will work how we will manage transitions between classes and in classroom protocols to ensure safe distancing we are working hard on these and other questions and i ask for your patience as we do so this is new territory for all of us
second i am turning to you today to say that this will take all of us working together and to invite your partnership along with the lsa faculty staff and my leadership team i have the greatest respect for your talents insights and commitment to your education this past march when we had to pivot quickly to remote teaching and learning we saw how much we can accomplish when were all working together rowing in the same direction i believe we can and must maintain that collaborative spirit because for this year to work well it will take all of us being rigorous about health and safety purposeful in pursuing our educational mission and generous with each other as we innovate and learn along the way
looking ahead to classes
as the president said in his message you will get to choose whether to participate in a hybrid learning experience a mixture of in person and online classes or whether to participate fully online
below is some additional information about classes well share more over the weeks ahead
all large lsa classes with enrollments over 45 will be fully available online
smaller classes and discussion sections may gather in person while maintaining social distancebut may also be partly or entirely online
whether courses meet in person or online all of them will offer ways that students can connect with the material virtually and asynchronously in case they become sick or need to self isolate
we are also working to identify which classes will be online in person or a hybrid we will share those details as soon as we have them so that you can confirm or adjust your class schedules
and just a reminder that the academic calendar will look different this year with a start date on august 31 no fall break and online coursework only after thanksgiving break through exams and the end of the semester winter semester will start on january 19 later than usual and there will be no spring break in 2021
as always we are also committed to providing you with tools and resources to enrich your classroom education to support your discovery of extracurricular experiences to help you prepare for life after graduation and to answer your questions the newnan advising center lsa opportunity hub optimize sweetland center for writing science learning center the math lab and the transfer student center are all ready to support your exploration and well being
if you havent had a chance yet i hope youll take the time to visit the universitys maize and blueprint guide for living and learning together on campus particularly the section for students and families the site has important information about safety housing the academic calendar and resources you can rely on this summer and throughout the academic year
finally remember that any time you have questions and dont know where to turn you can reach out to lsa covid help@umichedu where an lsa staff member can connect you with people and resources who can help you
i speak for my colleagues all across lsa when i say that we are very excited to see you at the end of august both on campus and online you are the heartbeat of the college and you inspire us every day with your insights infectious curiosity and drive to make the world a better place take good care of yourselves and please be in touch with us anytime
dear lsa students
as i wrote to all of you last week this is a moment in history that challenges us as individuals and as a college community to address racism and anti black violence to commit to sustained work on systemic change and to stand together
i hope you will join us for an lsa virtual panel tomorrow tuesday june 9 from 1230 to 200 pm to share ways in which our lsa community is grappling with recent events and to identify effective ways we can support one another especially our black students and colleagues and build a stronger more inclusive and equitable college we see this as an early step in the many crucial conversations around systemic racism that will lead us to necessary reflection a deeper commitment to equity and transformative action
there will be dedicated time for a q&a session as part of the discussion i look forward to hearing your thoughts and answering questions
dear fellow members of the lsa community
the past week has been one of the most painful in recent memory i am wrenched by what we are witnessing across the country and by the pain anger fear and exhaustion that i see and hear in our community i know many of us share these feelings but their effects have been especially devastating among members of the black community as we think about the anguish of this moment we must acknowledge the harrowing history and ongoing presence of racism in this country that it persists in such brutal ways including by those sworn to protect and serve makes it all the more shattering and infuriating
i am reaching out now in deeply felt anger and solidarity to state unequivocally that black lives matter and please pause on that statementon the fact that any community should have to assert that their lives matter i know that words cannot possibly be enough but silence is not acceptable the horrific killings of george floyd ahmaud arbery breonna taylor and so many black people before them are deeply and fundamentally wrong and theyre made worse by having been done within a system in which repression and brutality are normalized
i met with the associate deans earlier today and we are united in our commitment to the anti racism work that is integral to our success as a college a community and as a country as leaders of lsa we promise to continue to push for and contribute to needed systemic change including examining our own daily institutional practices and our culture we know that many of our lsa faculty students and staff are experts on the nature and problems of structural racism as a college this is an area where we can and must do more to support research teaching and evidence based interventions to combat racism discrimination and bias
the lsa dei office is organizing virtual events for the lsa community to gather online support one another and discuss how we can engage collectively in structural change both here and in the world we will share details as soon as we have them i am deeply grateful for this critical work i also would like to acknowledge that lifting each other up through racial discrimination and hate is exhausting and falls especially heavily on faculty staff and students of color
i ask that we stand together at this critical timeand in the coming weeks and monthsto support all members of our community and to share responsibility for systemic change please know also that you are always welcome to reach out to me
dear lsa students
this message contains important information for you particularly those still living on or near campus as you know governor whitmer has issued a shelter in place order for the state
one consequence of the order is that starting tonight at 600 pm lsa buildings will be open only to authorized personnel whose work in them is considered an essential service this means that undergraduate students will not have access to lsa buildings to study this more restricted access will be in place for at least the duration of the shelter in place order ie through april 13
i realize this is one more significant change on top of so many that we have already encountered i believe it is necessary to protect public health i also know how challenging it is to keep adapting to new circumstances i am especially aware that those of you still on campus may not have family support nearby and that this new order limits your ability to connect with others please remember that essential campus services to you will continue uninterrupted including food service and there are many people who stand ready to help you albeit now remotely academic advisors in the newnan advising center writing workshop and peer tutors at the sweetland center for writing coaches at the lsa opportunity hub tutors at the science learning center and many more
if youre having trouble getting access to the internet please check this information and these resources for computer related needs email lsait@umichedu or call 734 615 0100 if you are experiencing financial difficulties please know that you can apply for emergency funding through the lsa emergency scholarship
i want you to know i am thinking of you and that i am looking at ways we can connect as a community in the meantime i urge all of us to look out for one another provide support wherever we can and when we need help to ask for it
i will continue to stay in touch regularly please take good care of yourselves
dear lsa students
were writing today to express our profound appreciation for the enormous effort you have put into protecting the health and safety of everyone in the university of michigan community and to provide a few updates on the winter 2020 grading policy we also want you to be aware of a new resource for you lsa covid help@umichedu if you have questions or concerns you can email us here and we will route them to people who can help you get answers
we know these last few weeks have been terribly unstable and what we have seen you all work through is more than we ever thought wed have to ask for working together with faculty gsis and staff you all have helped to shift our giant residential liberal arts college to remote instruction this achievement rescues what might otherwise have been a lost semester and helps you to keep going at a time when so much else has come to a halt thank you again
below are a few important updates including information on supporting your well being and the new winter 2020 grading policy
well being
with two weeks of remote teaching complete some of the many challenges you all face completing the semester are now clear we all began the semester together on campus with you able to visit with us regularly in person supported by the physical social and technological infrastructure of a world class university the expectations we had for you in january were shaped by the existence of these strong supports
now most of you are far away experiencing environments which often lack the support you had on campus some of you are struggling with technology or internet bandwidth having trouble finding private study spaces or spending weeks in self isolation we can only imagine how difficult this is and we have asked your faculty to do what they can to help you work through this as well as assist us in providing additional support
if you feel youre at risk of not being able to complete the semester or have challenges that are making it difficult to learn in this remote environment we ask you to reach out please send an email to lsa covid help@umichedu and well work together with you on solutions
winter 2020 grading policy
a week ago the provost announced a new campus wide pass no record covid grading policy in order to allow students to focus on their learning during this transition to remote teaching formats while you will all have the option to unmask any of your course grades we expect most of you will want to retain these p nrc grades in addition to the general grading policy questions answers regarding grading this term that are on the registrars office website below is additional information about the grading policy as it relates to lsa specific degree requirements and information
p grades c  or higher will meet all course degree and graduation requirements
if you choose to unmask a course grade it will be subject to normal degree and graduation requirements
withdrawals you may withdraw from a course until april 21st
for any request to drop a course that was initiated march 10th or later the w withdrawn will not appear on your official transcript
incompletes if you are unable to participate in final elements of the course you can take an incomplete
you will then be expected to complete any unfinished work by the end of the 4th week in the fall 2020 term once that work is completed and a letter grade is reported it will be converted to the p nrc system and no record of the incomplete will remain
we hope that this course grading policy for winter 2020 will also be a reminder that gradesin and of themselvesare never the real point learning is this should free you from some of the constraints you might typically feel from grades please use this freedom to focus as much as your circumstances will allow on your learning
thank you again for all youve done and for the work yet to come

dear lsa students
i am writing to follow up on acting provost susan collins earlier message about important changes to the universitys undergraduate grading policy this semester these changes were shaped by input and advocacy from both lsa students and faculty let me start by outlining the key features of this new policy
as you saw in the acting provosts message the primary change is that the default grading system for all courses will be pass nrc no record covid
a grade of c  or above will receive a p and full academic credit
a grade below a c  will be converted to nrc and not receive academic credit
neither p nor nrc grades will have any effect on gpa calculations
the deadline for withdrawing from a class without the course appearing on your transcript has been extended to april 21
because we recognize that some of you would prefer to record a letter grade you will have the option to unmask any of your grades in that case the course grade will be recorded and included in your gpa in the traditional way
we will provide additional details to you early next week so please stay tuned we will also provide guidance to your instructors and academic advisors so that they can support you as you make decisions regarding your courses this term
i want you to know that my fellow deans and i as well as president schlissel and acting provost susan collins have heard you express a variety of concerns about grades we know that the transition to remote teachingtaking place even as many of you are moving to new living situationsmakes this a very challenging time to learn we are also very aware that not all students have reliable access to the internet stable housing family support and other key resources right now
for many of you taking letter grades off the table will reduce pressure and allow you to focus on your learning for others earning reported letter grades is important or even necessary based on specific circumstances both views are understandable i hope this new policy provides the balance you need and alleviates at least some of the anxiety you may be feeling during this challenging semester
the health and well being of every member of our community is our top priority this is closely followed by our commitment to provide you with the best possible learning environment
again youll hear more details from us early next week in the meantime please take good care of yourselves and those around you i am sending good thoughts to all of you
dear lsa students
i am writing to follow up on president schlissels message from earlier this afternoon that while many university operations will remain unchanged we are taking a number of steps to reduce the potential spread of covid 19 these include canceling classes tomorrow and friday delivering classes remotely starting on monday and for the rest of the semester canceling events with more than 100 participants suspending or altering study abroad programs and suspending most university travel
i know that this announcement raises many questions how will classes and grading work will i get credits for uncompleted study abroad experiences will my research projects continue what will happen to my work study position we know the uncertainty is stressful and we in the lsa deans office and your course instructors will be getting you answers to these questions as quickly as we possibly can
the first thing i want you to know though is that all lsa faculty staff and administrators are committed to ensuring that you continue to have a rich and rewarding educational experience with as little disruption as possible to grades credits advising and the like your safety and health are our absolute top priority the quality and continuity of your education here in lsa come next in line
we expect that many students will want to leave campus and return to their permanent residence for the remainder of the term we encourage you to consider this as it will support the social distancing being recommended by public health experts but please know that michigan dining and u m housing will remain operational for all students who remain on campus and we know that not everyone has another place to go right now the university is working to make changes that will minimize health risks for students in our dorms and dining halls
i truly believe that we as a community are ready to rise to the challenges of this new situation it may though require some generosity and patience on all of our parts as we figure out some of the details this is an unprecedented situation and we are certain to face questions uncertainty and obstacles along the way please know that your instructors are working hard to revise their courses to be taught remotely and youll receive more information from them over the next few days well also be providing information about resources like writing support from the sweetland center for writing tutoring and study groups from the science learning center etc
i do think this is a moment where each of you as a student will be asked to assume active ownership of your educationreflecting on your own goals as a learner in every class proactively participating in all available opportunities for learning and pursuing any and all available avenues for support eg online office hours extra tutorials supplemental discussion spaces lets all try to make the most out of an unusual and undoubtedly memorable end of the semester
for some of you who have to change your plans to travel for study or research i know this is a real disappointment and i am sorry for that we are working through the status of international internships and other programs and will have more information on that soon
over the coming days and weeks i am committed to providing as much transparency and clarity as possible to promptly update you as decisions are made to listen and respond to your questions and concerns and to keep the health and well being of our community as our top priority i encourage all of us to support one another through this situation with compassion and understanding
please take good care of yourselves and those around you
dear lsa students
i hope that you enjoyed the break and were able to find some time to relax and recharge
as we return from break the situation around the covid 19 virus has evolved from just a week ago and continues to change rapidly we recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating so i write to share updates about how the college is currently responding to this ever changing environment please know that your safety and well being are the absolute priority
the universitys most current guidance concerning covid 19 can be found on the key issues page the decisions we make as a college will rely heavily on this guidance i also encourage you to carefully review president schlissels recent message which contains campus wide guidelines and important information that are relevant to everyone the college is working closely with the presidents office and the universitys global health experts to actively monitor the situation with the health and well being of our community as the foremost concern
classes and programming will continue as scheduled unless or until we have other university wide guidance
currently there is no university recommendation to cancel events being hosted on campus though we are advising those who are hosting events over the next several weeks to have contingency plans in place
if you have traveled to an area where transmission is widespread and need to self quarantine contact the dean of students office at 734 764 7420 or deanofstudents@umichedu to discuss your situation and follow the guidance provided in the faq section of the key issues page we are exploring tools to streamline this notification process
we have shared guidance with faculty for supporting students who may not be able to attend classes and i want to assure those who are unable to attend classes that we are committed to working with you and your instructors to accommodate needed absences and support options for remote teaching and learning
while there are currently no u m travel restrictions for domestic travel caution is advised around travel to areas with sustained community transmission of covid 19 we understand that many people may not want to travel right now so please consider what feels comfortable for you
winter study abroad programs in countries with a cdc level 3 notice have been canceled and we will be working with affected students to try and arrange completion of coursework through alternative means we will continue monitoring the situation so that we can make appropriate arrangements if additional countries rise to cdc level 3 we will send out updates as soon as possible about spring summer study abroad programs
i want to stress that if you are not well the most important thing is for you to take good care of yourself stay home and focus on getting well additionally we can all take everyday preventative actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases eg handwashing disinfecting high touch surfaces
please continue to read messages as theyre sent on this topic and check the universitys key issues page often for the latest information if you have questions concerns or ideas you can share them with us here
while the university and lsa are engaged in extensive contingency planning i know that these can be stressful times and topics for many of us so above all i want to encourage you to take care of yourselves and support the people around you
hello and welcome to 2020 as we kick off a new year i want to invite you to help shape the vision of lsas future we have so much to be proud of in lsa from our excellent teaching and research to innovative programs that set the standard for higher education around the world and we know we should always strive to do even better this is one of the many reasons i am excited about our strategic planning initiative help us determine what lsa embarks on next and how we go about it
your ideas and insights will inspire the creation of new statements of vision mission and values for the college which will serve as our north star in leading lsa to its highest potential

next week we will be hosting several community conversations where students staff and faculty will have a chance to share their experiences and ideas about lsas vision mission and core values have a say in how we can make lsa an even better place to learn teach work and pursue researchplus meet new people and have a snack while youre at it

to all members of the campus community
covid 19 cases are increasing on our campus and in the region state and nation as we noted last friday in our weekly briefing increases among students both on and off campus are heightening the pressure on our case investigators contact tracers and quarantine and isolation housing capacity
today the washtenaw county health department in collaboration with the university issued a 14 day stay in place order for our undergraduate students which goes into effect immediately we fully support this action as it enhances protections for our students and the welfare of our community we also are implementing steps beyond the order out of an abundance of caution and to provide choices for students and instructors including moving more of our undergraduate courses to fully remote instruction
we want to thank everyone who has been diligent in following public health guidelines and the many thousands of students and employees who have supported community health and safety your commitment to everyones safety will be an enormous help to our community for the rest of the semester and beyond the good work of so many will be crucial as we navigate the closing weeks of the semester
county stay in place order details
under the washtenaw county order u m undergraduate students living in on campus near campus or off campus housing in ann arbor will be required to stay in place and remain in their current designated residence the full set of restrictions is spelled out by the county here
the countys order is preventive as the document notes that covid 19 cases among 18 24 year old persons thus far in washtenaw county have not resulted in increased hospitalization or death rates additionally thus far the increased incidence in 18 24 year old persons has not been linked to increased incidence in other populations in washtenaw county additional preventive efforts are necessary to ensure that this remains so the order will be in place until at least nov 3
exceptions to the order include leaving a residence to attend class pick up food medication and other basic needs for medical appointments voting or volunteering as poll workers attending religious practice activities or obtaining covid 19 testing the order also specifies that undergraduate students can leave their residences for purposes of physical activity outdoors in groups of no more than two if appropriate preventive measures are followed
the order addresses social gatherings which have been identified as the main cause of recent covid 19 spread on campus in the surrounding community and the broader region most of the cases on our campus can be traced back to small  and medium size gatherings without appropriate face coverings and social distancing
the order is an important intervention to reduce the spread of the virus and it reflects the universitys close partnership with the county we have been coordinating on covid 19 since before the early days of the crisis todays order is in addition to the enhanced social distancing order for residents of mary markley hall issued last week
undergraduate course format and other changes
even though the risk of classroom transmission remains low  and the increasing covid 19 transmission we are seeing is not due to our classrooms and labs  we are issuing new guidelines for undergraduate course delivery to go into effect tomorrow and continue for the remainder of the semester for undergraduate students all classes that are substantially enhanced by in person instruction due to the nature of the instruction or space or equipment needs will continue to be taught in person most other undergraduate classes will be taught fully remotely
were taking this additional step to exercise an abundance of caution while also making it as simple as possible for undergraduate students to comply with the order provide choices for students and instructors and to support those students who may choose to leave ann arbor and finish their semester from home
each school or college will manage the process to enable exceptions for instructors who wish to continue teaching courses in person for instructional reasons instructors who will continue to teach in person are expected to notify their students
undergraduates will not be allowed to participate in in person research and scholarship however senior students engaged in in person research and scholarship for credit as part of a class or a thesis project can work with research leadership in their particular unit to request an exception undergraduates with campus jobs will still be able to go to work with the consent of their supervisors  under public health protocols
choices for leaving campus
with the shift to more remote instruction and the increased stress we know this kind of measure can add to an already challenging semester students may choose to return to their permanent homes depending on comfort levels and individual circumstances
the county health department order says that students who live in u m housing may only return to their permanent address if they follow u m testing and checkout procedures to be provided soon to lower the risk that they might carry disease home with them our procedures will include covid 19 testing which the university will provide for students who live in michigan housing or have dining plans and who wish to return to their permanent residence we are working out details to provide prorated room and board refunds or credits such refunds will be subject to potential financial aid implications that will need to be reviewed on a case by case basis
once a student returns home for safety reasons they will need to remain home
earlier this week in an effort to provide more covid 19 testing opportunities for michigan housing residents the university sent an email offering additional testing locations for the upcoming week of october 19 through its community sampling & tracking program
why these steps were taken
stay in place protocols and moving to increased remote instruction were amongst the potential mitigation strategies we shared earlier this semester  the response metrics that led us to this decision include increasing use of our isolation and quarantine housing more than 70 new cases per million in washtenaw county the markley cluster likely having more than 100 close contacts five days of sustained increases in cases and inability to perform prompt case investigation and contact tracing
wastewater testing has validated our mapping of covid 19 on campus were seeing the virus most prevalently in areas we expect  in our quarantine and isolation housing and in hill area residence halls which includes markley
to reduce transmission and assist our case investigators we urge everyone to please wear your face coverings rigorously maintain social distance reduce gathering sizes and comply with the county order for undergraduates complete daily symptom checks using responsiblue and be vigilant especially when you are indoors it is of crucial importance that everyone respond and cooperate honestly and fully with contact tracers as well we need the best and most accurate and timely information to be able to optimally target interventions  and avoid broader restrictions  this call for cooperation is also part of the countys action today
additional information on todays changes
well post any additional changes due to the order on the campus maize and blueprint site but we want to emphasize that many of our activities will not change
most on campus services including our libraries will continue as they have during this semester though with increased remote modalities the michigan union will remain open for many services as well
the county order exempts intercollegiate athletics so long as practices and competitions occur under medical supervision and regular virus tests are conducted by the big ten according to its approved protocols there has not been documented transmission of covid 19 among student athletes in our athletics facilities u m supports the leagues testing program and the staff of the athletic department are committed to protocols that protect the health of our student athletes
campus staff will continue their work under the guidelines that have been in place all who can work remotely must continue to do so
we know the increase in cases is causing a lot of stress in our community please take advantage of the mental health and well being resources we have in places for students campus faculty and staff and michigan medicine employees
more information will be coming soon from student life and your schools colleges and departments to share further details and address questions we are moving up the regular campus covid 19 weekly briefing from friday to this evening at 5 pm an updated invitation will be sent later today well also post the video from the briefing here when it is ready
we want to thank the members of the covid 19 campus health response committee for the tremendous work that informed these changes from the start our plans were designed to be flexible and adaptive based on campus conditions
we also appreciate everyone in our community who has shared their thoughts and concerns with us your commitment to our community and patience as we address the covid 19 pandemic continues to be essential for our success working together we will bring our fall semester to a successful conclusion in december plans for the winter 2021 semester will be announced in early november
to all members of the campus community
i want to thank everyone who has signed up for asymptomatic testing through our community sampling & tracking program and urge everyone on campus to participate this is an important tool we use to monitor covid 19 and we have capacity that is going unused
there has been a troubling increase in covid 19 activity across the region and around the state and nation with new cases often attributed to social gatherings both indoors and outside as noted below we are also experiencing a significant increase in cases amongst those in our residence halls we are entering a critical phase in our effort to control the pandemic in our university community
our transition to saliva testing through our lynxdx partnership now in its first full week has doubled our asymptomatic testing capacity and made it easier to take a test we have opened an additional cstp testing location on north campus at pierpont commons  in addition to the one weve had at palmer commons on central campus this week we also began rotating on site testing at residence halls schedule available here
after positive cases and close contacts were moved to isolation and quarantine related to last weeks cluster of positive cases in mary markley our additional testing identified 12 cases on the third floor of the residence hall
together with the washtenaw county health department our public health experts have recommended 14 days of enhanced social distancing for residents on the third floor of markley and asked them not to attend in person classes we have used enhanced social distancing in certain residence hall responses to separate asymptomatic and healthy individuals from possible exposure this includes monitoring your health reducing contact with others and following public health guidance as noted in the previous link at this time our case investigation has found no evidence of additional clusters within the building as a further precaution university health service has provided mandatory pop up testing for the remaining markley residents who were not previously tested in the past 14 days
the additional testing is an example of how we are deploying testing in response to conditions on our campus i encourage both students living on campus and off who think they may be infected to get tested for the virus through our university health service its fast convenient and easy and the results come back more quickly allowing us to more effectively intervene to prevent spread of the pandemic testing does not prevent infection however so its vitally important to remember to keep groups small practice social distancing and wear your face coverings
campus weekly covid 19 briefing
the video for this weeks campus weekly covid 19 briefing is available here we are continuing to post videos of previous briefings and answers to some of the questions we werent able to get to here

dr malani has shared some additional details about our campus in her video message today
overall case counts have been lower this week compared with recent weeks at both the campus and county level we identified some small clusters in residence halls but none of the clusters has had more than 100 close contacts nor have we exceeded capacity for contact tracing determined in collaboration with washtenaw county health officials
all positive cases and known close contacts were isolated or quarantined additionally we conducted broader pop up asymptomatic testing in several residence halls as a precaution for mary markley south quad and west quad this included offering tests to more than 700 residents
several large off campus houses were under quarantine as a targeted response as well following consultation with our department of environment health & safety and the county health department we also offered broader asymptomatic testing of individuals living in those settings an ongoing review of the situation is being conducted by campus and county public health officials to determine what additional mitigation strategies may be considered
saliva testing expansion
our community sampling and tracking program is switching to a saliva based collection method for u m surveillance testing at the same time were streamlining the sign up process expanding campus testing locations and increasing capacity for testing of students faculty and staff on the ann arbor campus
i urge everyone on campus to sign up for this program currently we are testing about 1200 individual volunteers per week with this program despite having the capacity to test more than twice that number the change to saliva based collection will further increase capacity to 6000 per week by the end of month  but you must sign up to be tested under this program more details on this important change are available in the university record
additional updates
the michigan department of health and human services and the washtenaw county health department announced emergency measures monday to keep covid 19 prevention and control strategies in place after a michigan supreme court ruling last week created uncertainty for gov gretchen whitmers executive orders the measures include wearing face coverings limiting gathering sizes and mandatory daily health screenings of employees u m and the county have existing measures in place for these orders additional details are available in the university record
a reminder that although the university of michigan is currently under spending hiring restrictions these measures do not apply to the spending of federal or sponsored funds including hiring for the purpose of completing the aims of a sponsored project faculty are encouraged to work with their schools and departments to process hiring and equipment spending on their externally funded grants
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to help keep everyone informed and address concerns and respond to feedback and questions from our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates
to all members of the campus community
now that we are a month into the semester university of michigan chief health officer and michigan parent preeti malani reports that cases have been increasing the last two weeks and shares updates on our campus and how we can prevent the spread of covid 19 her video is here and im sharing additional details and information below
in response to suggestions from the community our covid 19 dashboard now includes positive u m cases reported by off campus sources though weve always tracked total cases in conjunction with the washtenaw county health department we want our dashboard to reflect campus community conditions as accurately as possible
the university record has additional information about our recent dashboard improvements
also these numbers are adjusted after initial posting as we learn more about the onset of cases and as additional results are reported from outside labs our dashboard presents data from multiple u m county and state sources the full explanation is here we continue to work in close partnership with the health department to provide data and keep the community safe
i want to emphasize again the importance of students being tested at uhs especially in light of the numbers of positive cases that we are seeing identified by off campus testing
the benefits of having the test completed at uhs rather than an outside facility include the rapid turnaround time for results thanks to lab staff at michigan medicine use of the most accurate test available pcr and that we can begin case investigation and contact tracing more quickly diminishing spread of covid 19 the health department shares positive and probable cases from outside tests involving michigan students however those extra steps introduce a delay information and videos by our campus experts on this topic are available here
students isolated with a positive test or those instructed to quarantine due to an exposure are not necessarily required to do so on north campus sometimes this can happen at a current residence or permanent home depending on the nature of those living arrangements in addition we have worked hard to improve the quality of u m isolation and quarantine housing and have made significant progress
as part of our efforts to address your concerns and provide information more clearly we also have changed our campus maize and blueprint site to feature a section called top frequently asked questions on the sites front page these are questions we are hearing frequently and we want to make it easier for everyone to access the information
our environment health and safety department and the county health department are addressing about 25 recent positive cases arising in student off campus congregate living residences student life is offering information and support as well
south quad pop up testing
our university health service uhs in collaboration with campus partners quickly addressed the cluster in south quad that was identified and reported last week teams implemented our existing public health and safety measures that included quarantine isolation case investigation disinfection and public notices
additionally they created a pop up site to test all students residing on two specific floors of south quad  as of monday the 221 test results received all came back negative indicating that the infection had not spread beyond the initial groups of students
these additional students were tested out of an abundance of caution as none of them were identified as close contacts and none were experiencing covid 19 symptoms
weve posted more details online this includes a michigan minds podcast with lindsey mortenson acting uhs director who further describes this testing effort i join dr mortenson in thanking the students who stepped up to be tested in this important health and safety effort collaboratively implemented by uhs our school of public health and u m housing
additional updates
the office of the vice president for research has organized a committee to address inequities induced or exacerbated by covid 19 across the research community led by professors tabbye chavous and huda akil the committee will partner with colleagues from across our three campuses to reduce these negative impacts on researchers scholarly progress productivity and opportunity to thrive and help support an equitable diverse and robust research environment vice president for research rebecca cunningham will share more information about this committee with the university community in the coming weeks
the u m library has expanded its by reservation study hours in the shapiro library and borrowing services and contactless pickup at multiple locations more information is available in the university record and the library has full details on its site
autumn has begun and the days are starting to become cooler please make every effort to follow the rules around wearing a face covering avoiding crowds keeping the proper distance and washing your hands more frequently as socializing moves indoors  you can enjoy yourself stay healthy and protect others you care about by being smart about covid 19 risk
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to help keep everyone informed address concerns and respond to feedback and questions from our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates
to all members of the campus community
faculty students and staff continue to share their concerns about the need for greater testing resources more detailed and timely information about cases in our university community and other ways to help them stay safe were working hard to put these ideas into action
this weeks update contains information in all of these areas and important changes to our ambassador program based on feedback
the campus covid 19 dashboard now displays case numbers listed by residence hall we will update this data weekly upon verification by the state of michigans disease surveillance system we have also added to the dashboard a new section with data on surveillance testing these changes follow community requests for more detailed information
it is very important that u m students who feel ill or are concerned about possibly contracting covid 19 get their testing done through uhs its fast and easy we do get reports from the county health department about u m students testing positive at off campus facilities but this slows down the essential steps of case investigation and contact tracing that can help prevent spread to others
south quad update
as of yesterday there have been 19 confirmed positive cases in our south quad residence hall u ms environment health and safety department and the washtenaw county health department have identified this as a cluster
after extensive investigation the majority of the cases were found to be connected but three cases are not associated and have no known source of exposure while this can happen at any time during a pandemic situation we are taking additional measures to prevent the spread of covid 19 within the building all positive cases and close contacts have been moved to isolation or quarantine and all residents of the involved floors are being tested more information has been posted to the public health community notices section of our dashboard
expanded surveillance testing
we have entered into an agreement to begin offering saliva based covid 19 diagnostic surveillance testing on the ann arbor campus this new type of testing will begin early next month and allow the university to increase surveillance testing capacity to up to 6000 individuals per week through the voluntary u m covid 19 community sampling and tracking program
please sign up for this free covid 19 testing program using the link in the previous sentence so far more than 5700 students faculty and staff have volunteered and more than half are students who live off campus
the company providing the testing services under the new agreement is lynxdx a startup spun off of intellectual property developed on our campus
public health community notifications
we have heard a number of questions related to the public health community notifications that we post to make the community aware that there were people who tested positive for coronavirus in a particular u m building during their infectious period we recently began posting these notices in a section on our public dashboard the notices are posted as soon as they are available
when a u m student staff or faculty member tests positive for covid 19 a dedicated team of staff case investigators and contact tracers  working within u ms environment health & safety department  take steps to prevent the spread of the disease by isolating infected individuals and quarantining those who have been exposed to the virus and are at risk of developing covid 19
ehs leads contact tracing and issues notifications on campus because of staff familiarity with the campus community ability to act swiftly to identify and contact individuals and because of the departments years of experience handling infectious disease outbreaks
it is critically important that all community members make themselves available to speak with these staff if they reach out to contact you this is an important part of our efforts to prevent the spread of infection
ehs works in partnership with the washtenaw county health department as well
this is described in greater detail here
wolverine culture of cares new phase
in response to broad feedback from student organizations and campus groups and the need to continually evolve amid the changing conditions of the pandemic the wolverine culture of care initiative is refocusing its health and safety efforts
the universitys covid reporting line 734 647 3000 and voluntary address and phone registry for students living off campus will remain important components of our community health and safety efforts our division of student life set up the voluntary registry to promote outreach that reduces the need for law enforcement interventions this has been working well and i invite all students living off campus to sign up
the initiative changes also include discontinuing the use of students faculty and staff to canvas surrounding campus neighborhoods through the michigan ambassador program
while the universitys division of public safety and security and the ann arbor police department will maintain their regular on and near campus area work non emergency calls into the covid reporting line will continue to be answered by student life staff and volunteers and if no contact information is available for a reported address dpss staff will attempt to reach the residents prior to the involvement of aapd
additional information on changes to the wolverine culture of care program is available here
big ten announcement
earlier this week the big ten announced plans and safety protocols that will allow us to resume fall sports including football
when the league decided early last month to postpone fall sports it was because our medical experts were not confident in the ability to prevent coronavirus transmission during full practices and competitions especially in contact sports in addition there was deep concern about reports and preliminary investigations of myocarditis inflammation of the heart in people recovering from covid 19 it was feared that the combination of intense exercise and myocarditis could be particularly dangerous for our student athletes
in the intervening weeks a task force worked out procedures including the use of a newly available fda approved daily viral antigen test that could assure that the playing fields and practice facilities were free of virus and a protocol for cardiac evaluation that would screen for myocarditis and other potential heart issues before allowing a recovering student to return to practice or competition testing will be paid for by the league and this will not affect testing capacity on our campus we are relying on daily testing for student athletes since their sport does not allow them to use methods to prevent the spread of disease available to everyone else masks social distancing and the avoidance of interacting with large groups of people
additional updates
our responsiblue health screening tool is now available as a free app for android and apple devices the self screens continue to be an important layer in our health and safety plans in addition to daily use of the new app i continue to urge everyone to follow our rules requiring that you wear face coverings when on campus
to date u m researchers on all three of our campuses have submitted more than 800 proposals to pursue covid related research launched more than 320 covid related research projects and authored more than 600 covid related publications advancing our knowledge of the virus and its impacts on our communities
two u m researchers tested positive for covid 19 this week bringing the total cases among researchers since march to nine ehs is managing contact tracing to protect the health and safety of our research community and at this time there is no indication of any virus transmission between laboratory or research coworkers
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to help keep everyone informed and address concerns and respond to feedback and questions from our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates
welcome to a new academic year at the university of michigan
this year more than ever we are called upon to care for one other our campuses will look and feel different as we share in the responsibility for following the public health guidelines that will help to keep us all safe
you are beginning or continuing your michigan journey during a time of great uncertainty the covid 19 pandemic is placing extraordinary challenges on us as students faculty staff  and as people because covid 19 is spread among people and affects each of us differently we all must do our part to prevent transmission theres too much at risk to let down our guard
our community has been hard at work preparing for the fall semester and i am pleased to share with you some words of encouragement from members of our community in this year's welcome back video
in ann arbor we are welcoming thousands of new students and more than 400 new faculty members either in person or remotely we can all be proud that the michigan here for them today remains a nurturing place for learning teaching research and service
please help encourage your classmates friends and colleagues to be smart and safe wear your face covering wash your hands maintain social distance and avoid larger crowds we're counting on everyone to care for one another we will continue to post updates about our work to address covid 19 on our campus maize and blueprint site
please stay safe help us keep everyone healthy and as always go blue
to all members of the campus community
during the semester i am providing weekly covid 19 updates to our community you may also view the university record for the latest stories and the campus maize and blueprint site for updates we have modified the design of the maize and blueprint site based on community feedback to make it easier to access the latest information and weve added a new public health notices page to proactively make the u m community aware of positive cases on campus and potential exposures
our case numbers remain low  and currently are lower than many other campuses who have different mixes of remote and in person instruction this is the result of excellent diligence from many in our community thank you for going above and beyond to help keep everyone safe
current data from the week beginning aug 30 as our semester was getting underway show 19 new cases 12 students 7 non students as our data dashboard notes non student cases include remote employees and exposures outside of campus
it is important that students who get tested privately off campus notify the university health service of their test results to assist in our ongoing assessment of covid 19 spread in the university community weve also created graphics to help students living on and off campus know what to do in various covid 19 related scenarios
although our lower case numbers are good the number of contacts per case continues to be high this is very much a concern we urge everyone to continue to practice social distancing and limit gathering sizes to help prevent further spread of covid 19 we have to maintain our vigilance to keep case numbers low
helping us with contact tracing for positive cases is our new contact tracing corps which we announced last week
we have also been hearing that some individuals who are positive are reluctant to disclose all of their contacts so as not to get them in trouble please be forthcoming with our contact tracers being able to reach everyone who may have an exposure is essential to our efforts to control spread and accurately assess risk in our community
responsiblue self screening tool
use of our responsiblue self screening tool has grown especially among students i thank everyone who is using this tool to self monitor their health usage is up about 25 percent since residence hall move in for students faculty staff and visitors
as a reminder each day all members of our campus community who enter campus buildings and facilities are required to check themselves for covid 19 symptoms by answering a brief set of questions using responsiblue the tool offers advice on where to seek care if you are not well and provides insights and visibility to the state of public health at u m
self screening was a key element of the safe ramp up of our research operations
voluntary surveillance testing program
testing has begun this week for our voluntary covid 19 community sampling and tracking program so far more than 4800 u m community members have signed up we continue to seek volunteers especially among students who live in on campus housing to fulfill our initial goal of 3000 tests per week we are examining ways to further increase this capacity surveillance testing suggested by many in our community is just one part of our multi tier testing and monitoring approach to help us limit the spread of covid 19
get your flu shot
i encourage everyone to get a flu shot as soon as possible the flu vaccine is important for individual and community health but its also an important tool in our plans to combat the pandemic because the symptoms of flu are very similar to covid 19 fewer cases of the flu will help us devote testing and other coronavirus resources to those who need them most
ill be getting my flu shot on monday
the university health service now has the flu vaccine for u m students there is no out of pocket expense this year your health insurance will be billed and any cost not covered by your insurance will be covered by the university
the university record shared information from mhealthy on flu vaccinations for employees
additional updates
we have heard a number of requests for more information about the metrics we are using to monitor conditions on our campus and adjust our plans these include considerations such as the rate of growth in the number of covid 19 cases and clusters the percentage of positive tests for the virus our capacity for case investigation and contact tracing quarantine capacity the level of covid 19 in ann arbor and washtenaw county and the capacity of michigan medicine the covid 19 campus health response committee is working to formalize these metrics and provide greater details and well share more as soon as we can well also be posting more detailed information on frequent questions from our community i know that there remains a great demand for different types of information
we have posted information on the universitys proposal to the graduate employees organization to end the strike the proposal was supported by geo leadership but rejected by a membership vote please see the message sent to campus earlier today from the provost and me for more thoughts on this situation and our challenges as a community
i again thank everyone for their hard work and diligence as the semester continues our progress thus far is because you care so deeply about your classmates colleagues and fellow community members
dear students
i hope you and your loved ones are having a safe healthy and enjoyable summer at the university of michigan we have spent the last few months preparing diligently to welcome you and begin another academic year
the weeks leading up to the start of school are always filled with excitement and some anxiety and the covid 19 pandemic has certainly added to everyone's worries
i am writing today to share a few of the ways we are working to create a safe and healthy living and learning environment on our campus  and to ask for your help the pandemic is growing worse in many parts of our nation and it will take our collective commitment to have a successful academic year
the most important measures we can all take are described in the video above
wear a mask when you're outside your home
wash your hands more frequently
avoid crowded places especially indoors but also outdoor gatherings
these are health and safety measures that are based on research and they will help to protect you and your fellow students as well as your roommates professors family members and everyone in our communities further recommendations and developments will be posted to our campus maize and blueprint site
vice president for student life martino harmon and university health service executive director rob ernst shared additional information with you on monday and i want to emphasize it here we want to be sure that you feel free to decide the best option for you this year
courses
we are finalizing our course selection website with information on formats  in person hybrid or fully remote  to help you choose which classes you want to take about 70 percent of credit hours for undergraduates will be taken fully remotely this fall among those currently registered with many hybrid courses offering the option to attend remotely as well final course format information will be posted august 7
please review your course selections with the class formats in mind as you decide whether to come to ann arbor or study remotely from home this semester
we realize that many majors require courses that can only be effective in person and we're committed to offering those we also know that our new international students need to take some in person or hybrid classes because of federal guidelines
if all the courses you need are available remotely however you may choose to remain at home and pursue your studies this fall this is especially true if you or your family have risk factors that make covid 19 more dangerous
you will receive a high quality education and continue progress towards your michigan degree regardless of the class formats you choose your professors have been hard at work to ensure that the education we offer remains world class also many of the services provided by student life such as counseling and psychological services and student advising will be available remotely
students who have already signed housing contracts will be allowed to cancel without penalty until august 14 we will amend our usual rules and allow students with housing contracts who study remotely in the fall semester to apply for housing in the winter semester and we will make every effort to accommodate all requests
health and safety updates
if you do choose to come back to ann arbor we have made numerous preparations to keep you as safe as possible but as i said above you will have to be committed to do your part
all us students coming to ann arbor will need to practice enhanced social distancing during the 14 days before arriving during these two weeks monitor your health reduce your contact with others and follow the guidance shared by vice president harmon and dr ernst the 14 day period will begin upon arrival for students arriving from international destinations students coming from some us locations with high incidence of covid 19 may need to practice additional distancing upon arrival as well we will track this information and let you know which locations may have additional distancing requirements before your arrival in ann arbor
we'll also ask you to complete an online learning module that includes important information on covid 19
students moving into u m housing's residence halls and apartments are expected to be tested for the virus that causes covid 19 and be cleared before arriving in ann arbor u m is partnering with quest diagnostics to provide testing kits at no additional cost directly to on campus housing students to self administer and then mail back to quest for analysis
if you are planning to live in u m housing you will receive an email this week with additional information and instructions on testing students living in our munger graduate residences had an earlier move in and they are being tested after arrival
if you choose to come to campus you can expect to see a carefully crafted response to how we handle suspected or positive cases of covid 19 this includes
we'll offer students virus testing when indicated and care through our university health service
we'll continue to work closely with local public health officials to perform contact tracing for all infected students and employees as we have throughout the pandemic
we'll support and provide living space for any student who develops symptoms or tests positive and needs to quarantine or isolate safely this includes meal delivery
we have created an online tool so members of our community can check any symptoms daily the tool also offers advice on seeking care we're modifying the tool for students and it will be available later this month
we are working on a plan to perform surveillance testing of students in residence halls
wolverine culture of care
the first weeks after you arrive are pivotal to our shared health and success as well
as i've previously noted u m is requiring all students staff faculty and visitors to wear a face covering that covers the mouth and nose while anywhere on campus grounds this includes when inside buildings outdoors and on u m transportation on all of our campuses it is difficult on a busy university campus to maintain distance from groups even while outdoors so requiring face coverings outdoors will help slow the spread of the virus one exception is when you're in your own room or residence
the research is clear that wearing a face covering is one of the most effective tools we have for preventing the spread of covid 19 and saving lives
our division of student life worked closely with u m students across campus this summer to develop the wolverine culture of care  a commitment to keeping the u m campus community as healthy and safe as possible we encourage you to review and post these guidelines as a reminder on how to best care for yourself and to be respectful of your shared responsibility for the health of others
this is crucial not just for you and your friends and family members but for the thousands of people who live in ann arbor or work on our campus across the country and here in michigan we've seen how one gathering or party can cause an outbreak each incident places additional demands on our health care professionals contact tracers and staff across the university city and county
thank you for choosing u m
i want to express my appreciation and admiration to all of you you've chosen to study at a premier public research university in one of higher education's most dynamic academic environments
i know that we are asking you to take on responsibilities that go above and beyond what was expected several months ago wear a facing covering avoid gatherings connect with friends and loved ones remotely take some or all classes online
but you chose michigan because you knew you were ready for a challenge we now hope you will extend that enthusiasm to meet a challenge not only from your academics but from a world that has changed  and a world that you can help to ensure will change for the better bolstered by your university of michigan education
throughout the many difficulties of the pandemic i've been amazed by the incredible resilience and talents of you our students world class education during a pandemic is no small feat it's hard and rarely as smooth as we would like this is true for us as teachers and you as learners
for months you've shared with us your resilience your innovative ideas for how to make our university safer and your outstanding commitment to a university that aspires to create a better world for all
thank you all so much stay safe and healthy see you soon
to all members of the university community
i am writing today to share the good news that our state has entered a new stage in our recovery from the covid 19 pandemic gov gretchen whitmer announced monday that she has rescinded the stay home stay safe order for all parts of our state and we are transitioning to the improving phase of the mi safe start plan
i know many of you have questions about how this affects our campuses employees and students for now much of what we are doing on our campuses will not change but cautious reactivation of various in person activities will continue with additional details provided below
our ability to feel positive however is diminished by the tragic deaths of george floyd ahmaud arbery and breonna taylor that represent a different kind of pandemic  racism that continues to plague our communities earlier today i sent a message to our community inviting everyone to a virtual student town hall planned for friday at noon to attempt to promote healing and examine these essential issues
i again want to thank everyone in the u m community who has spoken out advanced peaceful protest offered support and sent the message that we wont tolerate any form of racism or vile acts that end the lives of our fellow human beings
u ms next steps in the covid 19 recovery
gov whitmers announcement monday demonstrates that together we are gaining the upper hand in our work to reduce the spread of covid 19 social distancing and stepped up hygiene practices are working
i applaud the experts from our school of public health and other parts of our campuses who have helped to inform decisions at the state and campus levels all of michigan is in a better place thanks to the scientific understanding professionalism and dedication of many members of our community
i want to emphasize that public health guidelines will remain in place for many operations even as we continue our gradual reactivation we need to ask you to help us implement and follow these guidelines and consider next steps as conditions improve just like we came together to flatten the curve
if you can work from home please continue to do so working from home when possible follows the governors ongoing guidance as well as the recommendations of our own public health and medical professionals this remains crucial to our efforts to keep density low on campus to prevent a second wave of infection from affecting us our colleagues and loved ones please do not come into work on campus unless directed by your supervisor if conditions allow more in person work to occur in the weeks ahead we will share that information
research labs will continue their gradual ramp up our office of researchs careful deliberate plan for the orderly and gradual resumption of research is working well and will continue this is the result of extraordinary collaboration among many units including our schools and colleges facilities and operations our division of public safety and security and information and technology services i know that other units are using this work as a template for their own preparations
fall planning will continue our schools colleges and departments will continue to engage in their thorough planning for the fall semester we will announce details later this month many dozens of individuals are engaged in these efforts across our university and i thank them for their considerable efforts i remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to deliver a public health informed fall semester on our three campuses safely and with as much in person instruction as possible
social distancing and wearing face coverings in enclosed spaces remain essential this component of the governors guidance has not changed we also continue to urge everyone to follow smart hygiene practices such as hand washing and please continue to monitor any symptoms you may have and stay home if youre sick
employees already working on campus may continue to do so faculty and staff in some units have been working in person following public health guidelines this will continue as well
plans for museums and libraries will be shared soon the new executive order permits the opening of museums and libraries on june 8 with public health precautions were working on what this specifically will look like on our campuses and will share details including when we will open these resources as soon as we can
the governors announcement also permits outdoor social gatherings and events of up to 100 people with everyone maintaining six feet of distance indoor gatherings and events continue to be limited to 10 or fewer however additionally some restrictions on retail and dining in are being relaxed
i know that after such a long period of being asked to stay home the temptation is strong to return to normal activities i urge everyone to follow social distancing guidelines when going out our continued success and improvement in controlling this pandemic depend on all of us we will share more information on how these and other changes will affect our campus operations  but for now the bulleted items above remain in place for our uniaversity
all of you have my most sincere gratitude for your help in saving lives while continuing to fulfill the mission of the university during this pandemic i look forward to the day when we can all be together again

good morning
hopefully everyone is having a wonderful start to their week i'm reaching out yet again with some more leasing updates
i want to first thank you all for being so patient and understanding as we try to navigate leasing during covid 19 it is definitely a challenge to keep everyone safe while also continuing to rent apartments and you have been so kind and accommodating
on that note we have been totally flooded with rental inquiries for 2021 2022 we anticipated that leasing might be slower this year due to covid 19 but that doesn't appear to be the case with this happening we're making adjustments to our leasing plans this year we will ideally be able to offer prospective tenants the options of in person tours or zoom meetings to watch videos you have sent you can choose from the options below for what feels most comfortable and safe for you and your roommates
1 you can elect to prohibit in person touring of your house or apartment we absolutely understand if this is the case per previous emails we do need a video and pictures of your apartment house for this option to be chosen please turn those into leasing@varsitymanagementcom by october 19th at the latest
2 you can allow in person touring of your house or apartment you will find detailed in the next section our plans for making this as safe as possible if you choose this option we would still like a video and pictures of your apartment house by october 19th this will help us limit the amount of tours that occur as well as allow us to offer options to prospective tenants if they don't feel safe touring in person
if you choose to allow in person tours here are the measures we're taking to promote safety and wellness of residents staff and prospective tenants
all people present for the tour will be wearing a mask gloves and shoe covers
one leasing agent will conduct the tour and one of the prospective tenants will be allowed to attend the tour there will not be more than two people at a time on a tour of your apartment
screening questions will be emailed to the prospective tenants before their tour and any answers that indicate a potential illness will result in cancellation or rescheduling of the tour
you can decide at anytime to change your mind and opt out of in person tours we just need 24 hours notice for this
we also ask that if you will be home that you're wearing a mask while the tour is happening please also notify us of any illness symptoms so we can cancel or reschedule the tour
if we don't receive a response from you or your roommates we will assume that you're okay with us conducting in person tours also note if you didn't renew last year or already confirm that you won't be renewing for 2021 2022 these tours will not begin until november 6th 2020
thank you for taking the time to read this and have a great tuesday
hopefully you all had a wonderful weekend and a great monday morning so far
we're getting leasing started much earlier this year than previous years because we will be doing things a bit differently
first if you already know you would like to renew or transfer please let us know you can complete the attached renewal application and we can get your paperwork going right away if you're not sure yet no worries you have first dibs on your home until november 6th if you know you won't be renewing please inform us as soon as possible so we can begin advertising your unit
in an effort to keep you prospective tenants and staff safe from covid 19 we will not be conducting in person tours this year for the 2021 2022 leasing season we will instead be offering zoom meetings during which we will show videos and pictures of the units and answer questions
to make this happen we need videos and pictures of your apartments houses you have two options for this
1 someone on your lease can send us a video and pictures of your home for us to use for zoom tours
if you choose this option
please have whoever has the newest phone in your group take pictures we would love for each room to be photographed from multiple angles
please try to shoot the video in portrait orientation before you start the video turn on all of the lights close toilet lids and close cabinet doors
during videos you can narrate if you want but you can also just be silent try to avoid showing people in the video and move slowly it is nice to see the inside of closets and some details like that if possible if you can start outside the front door of the building and go all the way into your apartment house that would be great please make sure to show any porches basements and the parking area if possible
2 we will notify you of a time for a varsity management representative to come over to take a video and pictures
if you choose this option
  the apartment will need to be vacated for the fifteen minute time slot of the appointment
  please notify us if you or a roommate has been sick so we can make different arrangements
the sooner you can get us these videos and pictures the better leasing begins on november 6th 2020 so that will be the deadline for you to send us content before we begin scheduling our own visits
some of you may have already sent us videos and pictures from last year please check in if this applies to you and we will let you know if we need anything additional
thank you for your understanding this seems like a lot but it should actually be much less intrusive than normal leasing seasons let me know if you have any questions
