dear lsa students
by now you have likely seen the news from the washtenaw county health department and university administration regarding new requirements related to covid 19 the county has issued a new two week stay in place order for all university of michigan undergraduates enrolled in fall 2020 courses on the ann arbor campus who are living in on campus near campus or off campus housing i recognize the news is a lot to process especially given the concerted efforts that thousands of you have put in to follow public health guidelines and keep our community safe over the first weeks of the semester but the numbers are trending in the wrong direction on campus and in the larger community and we need to take these preventive steps to reduce the spread of the virus
there is a lot of information to digest in the messages from the county and administration but were in this together and well get through this latest challenge here is a quick summary of key things to know right now
starting tomorrow wednesday october 21 nearly all lsa classes will move to a remote format for the remainder of the semester there may be a few exceptions for courses that have compelling instructional reasons for staying in person until the thanksgiving recess your instructor will reach out to let you know if that is the case otherwise you should assume your classes are fully remote
the county order states you should generally remain in your housing except if you need to
attend in person classes
pick up food and other basic necessities including medication
obtain health care including covid testing
attend work with the approval of your employer
vote and take part in election activities at polling places
participate in religious services and activities
participate in physical activity outdoors in groups of no more than two
some lsa study spaces including some rooms you can reserve will remain open for you to take remote classes well be back in touch with those details in the next couple of days in order for us to keep these spaces open we need everyone to continue following all public health requirements including wearing face coverings and spatial distancing
starting tomorrow in person undergraduate laboratory research activity is temporarily paused with the exception of senior students engaged in research for credit or as a thesis project the university hopes to unpause undergraduate research at the end of the stay in place order
i realize you may have questions and concerns and were here to help you can also find information about university level topics such as tuition and housing on this website for questions about lsa and your classes you can talk to your instructor or department or email our hotline at lsa covid help@umichedu we want to hear from you and make sure you have what you need to succeed this semester a real person will get back to you quickly and well connect you to the information and resources you need
this is without a doubt a time when we are being asked to dig deep for some extra grit and it is a time to remember that everyone needs support to thrive please take good care of yourselves and one another and know that were here to support you at every step

dear lsa undergraduate students
as you probably know and as the provost emailed you about yesterday the graduate employees organization geo at the university of michigan began a strike as a result many gsis and other graduate employees have canceled course sections and other work many of you have had classes canceled i recognize that this is very disruptive especially during the second week of the semester as you figure out whether your classes are meeting how youll get your work done how you personally feel about the strike and perhaps whether you feel comfortable crossing a picket line to go to a class or a study space or a lab i am sorry
discussions on a number of matters are proceeding between geo and the provosts office and i very much hope that there will be a successful resolution very soon in the meantime we are moving as quickly as we can in lsa to provide continuous instruction in your courses given the sheer size of the college however we wont be able to fully cover all classes this week if you have questions or concerns about particular courses please contact the appropriate department directly please also be sure to reach out to your academic advisors for helpthere is a whole team here to support you
the lsa deans office has stated our expectation that all instructors will continue to fulfill their teaching responsibilities this week the strike violates the terms of the contract geo signed last spring geo agreed by contract not to take actions that interfere with the universitys operations which includes your education geo has raised many important concerns including ones we know many of you care deeply about as well most of these issues however are beyond the scope of their contract
one concern geo raised and which some of you have asked about is the safety of instructors amid the pandemic lsa is committed to the safety of all instructors as well as students and we know of no lsa instructorfaculty or gsiwho has been required to teach in person against their preferences or needs this has been very important to us
graduate students do vital work at the university and in lsa almost all of you have worked withor will work withgsis in your time as an lsa student and i know those connections can be very meaningful and even life changing parts of your education we in lsa feel very fortunate to work with some of the best graduate students in the country and we are grateful for everything they contribute to our excellence as a college
i sincerely hope that geo and the provosts office are able to resolve these disputes quickly knowing that all of us are eager to return to classes as soon as possible we are deeply committed to your education and we appreciate your patience as we respond to this very difficult situation
please know that you are welcome to reach out to me anytime

closing thoughts
i hope you find this information helpful i knowand still vividly remember from my own college experiencethat starting up or starting back to college can be both exciting and stressful and this years circumstances may intensify those emotions please know that we are committed to your success and well being as part of one of the greatest living and learning liberal arts communities in the world we firmly believe that everyone needs support to thrive and we have many support systems here physically and virtually just for you as the semester gets even closer ill be back in touch with a detailed reminder about those resources so you have the information at your fingertips when you start classes whether you are on campus or in your kitchen the courses you take the people you meet virtually or on campus and the things you experience will be life changing and we want each of you to thrive absolutely as much as possible this year
dear lsa students
i am writing to follow up on the news from president schlissel that the university of michigan will have an in person public health informed fall semester as the dean of the college of literature science and the arts and as a faculty member co teaching an undergraduate course called epic grammar fails this fall i am really looking forward to having the opportunity to engage with you in person and online there is an irrepressible and irreplaceable energy that you as students bring to campus and it inspires me every year
and while there is uncertainty ahead i want to start with a pledge and a certainty the pledge is to make your health and safety our first priority always the certainty is in the power and lasting relevance of lsas liberal arts and sciences education i truly believe that a liberal arts education has never been more important or more valuable than it is now we reimagine the world here in lsa and we can do that better because you are here in our community with all the diverse perspectives you bring we push the boundaries of whats understood about human experience and the natural world taking up the existential challenges of climate change systemic racism the biology of viruses and more we pursue these questions with rigor and empathy knowing that no one person or field of study has all the solutions and through research and learning we cultivate skills and mindsets that are fundamental to making purposeful positive change in the world
as the president mentioned the university is a big place and many practices need to be determined by individual schools and colleges like lsa i want to share some initial information about particular steps lsa will be taking with more details to follow in the weeks ahead
first i want to acknowledge that while we know a good deal about what the fall will look like there is much we dont yet know the university is still determining for example how regular virus screening will work how we will manage transitions between classes and in classroom protocols to ensure safe distancing we are working hard on these and other questions and i ask for your patience as we do so this is new territory for all of us
second i am turning to you today to say that this will take all of us working together and to invite your partnership along with the lsa faculty staff and my leadership team i have the greatest respect for your talents insights and commitment to your education this past march when we had to pivot quickly to remote teaching and learning we saw how much we can accomplish when were all working together rowing in the same direction i believe we can and must maintain that collaborative spirit because for this year to work well it will take all of us being rigorous about health and safety purposeful in pursuing our educational mission and generous with each other as we innovate and learn along the way
looking ahead to classes
as the president said in his message you will get to choose whether to participate in a hybrid learning experience a mixture of in person and online classes or whether to participate fully online
below is some additional information about classes well share more over the weeks ahead
all large lsa classes with enrollments over 45 will be fully available online
smaller classes and discussion sections may gather in person while maintaining social distancebut may also be partly or entirely online
whether courses meet in person or online all of them will offer ways that students can connect with the material virtually and asynchronously in case they become sick or need to self isolate
we are also working to identify which classes will be online in person or a hybrid we will share those details as soon as we have them so that you can confirm or adjust your class schedules
and just a reminder that the academic calendar will look different this year with a start date on august 31 no fall break and online coursework only after thanksgiving break through exams and the end of the semester winter semester will start on january 19 later than usual and there will be no spring break in 2021
as always we are also committed to providing you with tools and resources to enrich your classroom education to support your discovery of extracurricular experiences to help you prepare for life after graduation and to answer your questions the newnan advising center lsa opportunity hub optimize sweetland center for writing science learning center the math lab and the transfer student center are all ready to support your exploration and well being
if you havent had a chance yet i hope youll take the time to visit the universitys maize and blueprint guide for living and learning together on campus particularly the section for students and families the site has important information about safety housing the academic calendar and resources you can rely on this summer and throughout the academic year
finally remember that any time you have questions and dont know where to turn you can reach out to lsa covid help@umichedu where an lsa staff member can connect you with people and resources who can help you
i speak for my colleagues all across lsa when i say that we are very excited to see you at the end of august both on campus and online you are the heartbeat of the college and you inspire us every day with your insights infectious curiosity and drive to make the world a better place take good care of yourselves and please be in touch with us anytime
dear lsa students
as i wrote to all of you last week this is a moment in history that challenges us as individuals and as a college community to address racism and anti black violence to commit to sustained work on systemic change and to stand together
i hope you will join us for an lsa virtual panel tomorrow tuesday june 9 from 1230 to 200 pm to share ways in which our lsa community is grappling with recent events and to identify effective ways we can support one another especially our black students and colleagues and build a stronger more inclusive and equitable college we see this as an early step in the many crucial conversations around systemic racism that will lead us to necessary reflection a deeper commitment to equity and transformative action
there will be dedicated time for a q&a session as part of the discussion i look forward to hearing your thoughts and answering questions
dear fellow members of the lsa community
the past week has been one of the most painful in recent memory i am wrenched by what we are witnessing across the country and by the pain anger fear and exhaustion that i see and hear in our community i know many of us share these feelings but their effects have been especially devastating among members of the black community as we think about the anguish of this moment we must acknowledge the harrowing history and ongoing presence of racism in this country that it persists in such brutal ways including by those sworn to protect and serve makes it all the more shattering and infuriating
i am reaching out now in deeply felt anger and solidarity to state unequivocally that black lives matter and please pause on that statementon the fact that any community should have to assert that their lives matter i know that words cannot possibly be enough but silence is not acceptable the horrific killings of george floyd ahmaud arbery breonna taylor and so many black people before them are deeply and fundamentally wrong and theyre made worse by having been done within a system in which repression and brutality are normalized
i met with the associate deans earlier today and we are united in our commitment to the anti racism work that is integral to our success as a college a community and as a country as leaders of lsa we promise to continue to push for and contribute to needed systemic change including examining our own daily institutional practices and our culture we know that many of our lsa faculty students and staff are experts on the nature and problems of structural racism as a college this is an area where we can and must do more to support research teaching and evidence based interventions to combat racism discrimination and bias
the lsa dei office is organizing virtual events for the lsa community to gather online support one another and discuss how we can engage collectively in structural change both here and in the world we will share details as soon as we have them i am deeply grateful for this critical work i also would like to acknowledge that lifting each other up through racial discrimination and hate is exhausting and falls especially heavily on faculty staff and students of color
i ask that we stand together at this critical timeand in the coming weeks and monthsto support all members of our community and to share responsibility for systemic change please know also that you are always welcome to reach out to me
dear lsa students
this message contains important information for you particularly those still living on or near campus as you know governor whitmer has issued a shelter in place order for the state
one consequence of the order is that starting tonight at 600 pm lsa buildings will be open only to authorized personnel whose work in them is considered an essential service this means that undergraduate students will not have access to lsa buildings to study this more restricted access will be in place for at least the duration of the shelter in place order ie through april 13
i realize this is one more significant change on top of so many that we have already encountered i believe it is necessary to protect public health i also know how challenging it is to keep adapting to new circumstances i am especially aware that those of you still on campus may not have family support nearby and that this new order limits your ability to connect with others please remember that essential campus services to you will continue uninterrupted including food service and there are many people who stand ready to help you albeit now remotely academic advisors in the newnan advising center writing workshop and peer tutors at the sweetland center for writing coaches at the lsa opportunity hub tutors at the science learning center and many more
if youre having trouble getting access to the internet please check this information and these resources for computer related needs email lsait@umichedu or call 734 615 0100 if you are experiencing financial difficulties please know that you can apply for emergency funding through the lsa emergency scholarship
i want you to know i am thinking of you and that i am looking at ways we can connect as a community in the meantime i urge all of us to look out for one another provide support wherever we can and when we need help to ask for it
i will continue to stay in touch regularly please take good care of yourselves
dear lsa students
were writing today to express our profound appreciation for the enormous effort you have put into protecting the health and safety of everyone in the university of michigan community and to provide a few updates on the winter 2020 grading policy we also want you to be aware of a new resource for you lsa covid help@umichedu if you have questions or concerns you can email us here and we will route them to people who can help you get answers
we know these last few weeks have been terribly unstable and what we have seen you all work through is more than we ever thought wed have to ask for working together with faculty gsis and staff you all have helped to shift our giant residential liberal arts college to remote instruction this achievement rescues what might otherwise have been a lost semester and helps you to keep going at a time when so much else has come to a halt thank you again
below are a few important updates including information on supporting your well being and the new winter 2020 grading policy
well being
with two weeks of remote teaching complete some of the many challenges you all face completing the semester are now clear we all began the semester together on campus with you able to visit with us regularly in person supported by the physical social and technological infrastructure of a world class university the expectations we had for you in january were shaped by the existence of these strong supports
now most of you are far away experiencing environments which often lack the support you had on campus some of you are struggling with technology or internet bandwidth having trouble finding private study spaces or spending weeks in self isolation we can only imagine how difficult this is and we have asked your faculty to do what they can to help you work through this as well as assist us in providing additional support
if you feel youre at risk of not being able to complete the semester or have challenges that are making it difficult to learn in this remote environment we ask you to reach out please send an email to lsa covid help@umichedu and well work together with you on solutions
winter 2020 grading policy
a week ago the provost announced a new campus wide pass no record covid grading policy in order to allow students to focus on their learning during this transition to remote teaching formats while you will all have the option to unmask any of your course grades we expect most of you will want to retain these p nrc grades in addition to the general grading policy questions answers regarding grading this term that are on the registrars office website below is additional information about the grading policy as it relates to lsa specific degree requirements and information
p grades c  or higher will meet all course degree and graduation requirements
if you choose to unmask a course grade it will be subject to normal degree and graduation requirements
withdrawals you may withdraw from a course until april 21st
for any request to drop a course that was initiated march 10th or later the w withdrawn will not appear on your official transcript
incompletes if you are unable to participate in final elements of the course you can take an incomplete
you will then be expected to complete any unfinished work by the end of the 4th week in the fall 2020 term once that work is completed and a letter grade is reported it will be converted to the p nrc system and no record of the incomplete will remain
we hope that this course grading policy for winter 2020 will also be a reminder that gradesin and of themselvesare never the real point learning is this should free you from some of the constraints you might typically feel from grades please use this freedom to focus as much as your circumstances will allow on your learning
thank you again for all youve done and for the work yet to come

dear lsa students
i am writing to follow up on acting provost susan collins earlier message about important changes to the universitys undergraduate grading policy this semester these changes were shaped by input and advocacy from both lsa students and faculty let me start by outlining the key features of this new policy
as you saw in the acting provosts message the primary change is that the default grading system for all courses will be pass nrc no record covid
a grade of c  or above will receive a p and full academic credit
a grade below a c  will be converted to nrc and not receive academic credit
neither p nor nrc grades will have any effect on gpa calculations
the deadline for withdrawing from a class without the course appearing on your transcript has been extended to april 21
because we recognize that some of you would prefer to record a letter grade you will have the option to unmask any of your grades in that case the course grade will be recorded and included in your gpa in the traditional way
we will provide additional details to you early next week so please stay tuned we will also provide guidance to your instructors and academic advisors so that they can support you as you make decisions regarding your courses this term
i want you to know that my fellow deans and i as well as president schlissel and acting provost susan collins have heard you express a variety of concerns about grades we know that the transition to remote teachingtaking place even as many of you are moving to new living situationsmakes this a very challenging time to learn we are also very aware that not all students have reliable access to the internet stable housing family support and other key resources right now
for many of you taking letter grades off the table will reduce pressure and allow you to focus on your learning for others earning reported letter grades is important or even necessary based on specific circumstances both views are understandable i hope this new policy provides the balance you need and alleviates at least some of the anxiety you may be feeling during this challenging semester
the health and well being of every member of our community is our top priority this is closely followed by our commitment to provide you with the best possible learning environment
again youll hear more details from us early next week in the meantime please take good care of yourselves and those around you i am sending good thoughts to all of you
dear lsa students
i am writing to follow up on president schlissels message from earlier this afternoon that while many university operations will remain unchanged we are taking a number of steps to reduce the potential spread of covid 19 these include canceling classes tomorrow and friday delivering classes remotely starting on monday and for the rest of the semester canceling events with more than 100 participants suspending or altering study abroad programs and suspending most university travel
i know that this announcement raises many questions how will classes and grading work will i get credits for uncompleted study abroad experiences will my research projects continue what will happen to my work study position we know the uncertainty is stressful and we in the lsa deans office and your course instructors will be getting you answers to these questions as quickly as we possibly can
the first thing i want you to know though is that all lsa faculty staff and administrators are committed to ensuring that you continue to have a rich and rewarding educational experience with as little disruption as possible to grades credits advising and the like your safety and health are our absolute top priority the quality and continuity of your education here in lsa come next in line
we expect that many students will want to leave campus and return to their permanent residence for the remainder of the term we encourage you to consider this as it will support the social distancing being recommended by public health experts but please know that michigan dining and u m housing will remain operational for all students who remain on campus and we know that not everyone has another place to go right now the university is working to make changes that will minimize health risks for students in our dorms and dining halls
i truly believe that we as a community are ready to rise to the challenges of this new situation it may though require some generosity and patience on all of our parts as we figure out some of the details this is an unprecedented situation and we are certain to face questions uncertainty and obstacles along the way please know that your instructors are working hard to revise their courses to be taught remotely and youll receive more information from them over the next few days well also be providing information about resources like writing support from the sweetland center for writing tutoring and study groups from the science learning center etc
i do think this is a moment where each of you as a student will be asked to assume active ownership of your educationreflecting on your own goals as a learner in every class proactively participating in all available opportunities for learning and pursuing any and all available avenues for support eg online office hours extra tutorials supplemental discussion spaces lets all try to make the most out of an unusual and undoubtedly memorable end of the semester
for some of you who have to change your plans to travel for study or research i know this is a real disappointment and i am sorry for that we are working through the status of international internships and other programs and will have more information on that soon
over the coming days and weeks i am committed to providing as much transparency and clarity as possible to promptly update you as decisions are made to listen and respond to your questions and concerns and to keep the health and well being of our community as our top priority i encourage all of us to support one another through this situation with compassion and understanding
please take good care of yourselves and those around you
dear lsa students
i hope that you enjoyed the break and were able to find some time to relax and recharge
as we return from break the situation around the covid 19 virus has evolved from just a week ago and continues to change rapidly we recognize the uncertainty this global health issue is creating so i write to share updates about how the college is currently responding to this ever changing environment please know that your safety and well being are the absolute priority
the universitys most current guidance concerning covid 19 can be found on the key issues page the decisions we make as a college will rely heavily on this guidance i also encourage you to carefully review president schlissels recent message which contains campus wide guidelines and important information that are relevant to everyone the college is working closely with the presidents office and the universitys global health experts to actively monitor the situation with the health and well being of our community as the foremost concern
classes and programming will continue as scheduled unless or until we have other university wide guidance
currently there is no university recommendation to cancel events being hosted on campus though we are advising those who are hosting events over the next several weeks to have contingency plans in place
if you have traveled to an area where transmission is widespread and need to self quarantine contact the dean of students office at 734 764 7420 or deanofstudents@umichedu to discuss your situation and follow the guidance provided in the faq section of the key issues page we are exploring tools to streamline this notification process
we have shared guidance with faculty for supporting students who may not be able to attend classes and i want to assure those who are unable to attend classes that we are committed to working with you and your instructors to accommodate needed absences and support options for remote teaching and learning
while there are currently no u m travel restrictions for domestic travel caution is advised around travel to areas with sustained community transmission of covid 19 we understand that many people may not want to travel right now so please consider what feels comfortable for you
winter study abroad programs in countries with a cdc level 3 notice have been canceled and we will be working with affected students to try and arrange completion of coursework through alternative means we will continue monitoring the situation so that we can make appropriate arrangements if additional countries rise to cdc level 3 we will send out updates as soon as possible about spring summer study abroad programs
i want to stress that if you are not well the most important thing is for you to take good care of yourself stay home and focus on getting well additionally we can all take everyday preventative actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases eg handwashing disinfecting high touch surfaces
please continue to read messages as theyre sent on this topic and check the universitys key issues page often for the latest information if you have questions concerns or ideas you can share them with us here
while the university and lsa are engaged in extensive contingency planning i know that these can be stressful times and topics for many of us so above all i want to encourage you to take care of yourselves and support the people around you
hello and welcome to 2020 as we kick off a new year i want to invite you to help shape the vision of lsas future we have so much to be proud of in lsa from our excellent teaching and research to innovative programs that set the standard for higher education around the world and we know we should always strive to do even better this is one of the many reasons i am excited about our strategic planning initiative help us determine what lsa embarks on next and how we go about it
your ideas and insights will inspire the creation of new statements of vision mission and values for the college which will serve as our north star in leading lsa to its highest potential

next week we will be hosting several community conversations where students staff and faculty will have a chance to share their experiences and ideas about lsas vision mission and core values have a say in how we can make lsa an even better place to learn teach work and pursue researchplus meet new people and have a snack while youre at it

i am honored to be writing this message as the new dean of lsa im also a professor of english linguistics and education and this is my eighteenth year on the faculty at the university of michigan i feel lucky every day to be working in this remarkable college surrounded by faculty staff and students who inspire me with their curiosity and creativity their commitment to creating and sharing knowledge and their dedication to advancing the common good
youll hear me talk a lot about values such as exploration and discovery purposeful inclusion collaboration and well being i relish the value of play for its own sake and as a powerful tool for research and learning in my own academic work on the history of the english language for instance i love to study slang and both the systematic and quirky ways language changes im also a firm believer in identifying what gives us purposeas individuals and as a collegeso that we can remain mindful and focused on work and relationships that really matter to us
as we begin the year some of the best advice i can give you is about people actually i strongly encourage you to seek out faculty mentors faculty here care deeply about teaching and want to know you as individualsand these mentoring relationships can change your life also stretch yourself to make new friendsfriends who will teach you about worlds and perspectives different from your own
i also want to share with you a few of my priorities as dean at the top of my list is you lsas students i want to hear from you and learn from your ideas your well being and experience here are important to me and i will be creating ways to connect with you in meaningful ways
i will keep lsa focused on the core activities that make us excellent research and teaching diversity and inclusion demonstrating the power and relevance of a liberal arts education and building a community that supports all its members
creating an inclusive community is at the center of our diversity equity and inclusion plan which remains a top priority for me and lsa weve done important work in this area providing more than 2000 laptops and 360 passports to students with financial need hiring 24 collegiate fellows each a rising star with deep commitments to diversity equity and inclusion developing new resources for inclusive teaching and much more we are also expanding innovative student support programs such as the kessler presidential scholars program and comprehensive studies program
the lsa opportunity hub is another priority the hub was created specifically for lsa undergraduates please take advantage of it the hub can support you with internships coaching networking and professional workshopsand lsa offers scholarship funding so anyone can take advantage of internship opportunities regardless of financial situation as importantly the hubs coaches and mentors will support you in connecting what youre learning in your lsa classes with your life aspirations so that you can study what youre passionate about
finally in the coming year well be talking as a college about our mission and core values i will be seeking your input as we think about how to make lsa and its community even stronger
i look forward to working alongside all of you in the coming year and celebrating your accomplishments we will also undoubtedly confront challenges as a community and can expect that the stresses and conflicts in the world will have an impact here too to sustain a strong community where everyone has a chance to learn and thrive its more important than ever that we embody core values of the liberal arts such as deep listening engaging across difference and trusting that together we can find answers to the hardest of questions
