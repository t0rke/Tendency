when the people of america reflect that they are now called upon to decide a question which in its consequences must prove one of the most important that ever engaged their attention the propriety of their taking a very comprehensive as well as a very serious view of it will be evident nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of government and it is equally undeniable that whenever and however it is instituted the people must cede to it some of their natural rights in order to vest it with requisite powers it is well worthy of consideration therefore whether it would conduce more to the interest of the people of america that they should to all general purposes be one nation under one federal government or that they should divide themselves into separate confederacies and give to the head of each the same kind of powers which they are advised to place in one national government it has until lately been a received and uncontradicted opinion that the prosperity of the people of america depended on their continuing firmly united and the wishes prayers and efforts of our best and wisest citizens have been constantly directed to that object but politicians now appear who insist that this opinion is erroneous and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in union we ought to seek it in a division of the states into distinct confederacies or sovereignties however extraordinary this new doctrine may appear it nevertheless has its advocates and certain characters who were much opposed to it formerly are at present of the number whatever may be the arguments or inducements which have wrought this change in the sentiments and declarations of these gentlemen it certainly would not be wise in the people at large to adopt these new political tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded in truth and sound policy it has often given me pleasure to observe that independent america was not composed of detached and distant territories but that one connected fertile widespreading country was the portion of our western sons of liberty providence has in a particular manner blessed it with a variety of soils and productions and watered it with innumerable streams for the delight and accommodation of its inhabitants a succession of navigable waters forms a kind of chain round its borders as if to bind it together while the most noble rivers in the world running at convenient distances present them with highways for the easy communication of friendly aids and the mutual transportation and exchange of their various commodities with equal pleasure i have as often taken notice that providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united peoplea people descended from the same ancestors speaking the same language professing the same religion attached to the same principles of government very similar in their manners and customs and who by their joint counsels arms and efforts fighting side by side throughout a long and bloody war have nobly established general liberty and independence this country and this people seem to have been made for each other and it appears as if it was the design of providence that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren united to each other by the strongest ties should never be split into a number of unsocial jealous and alien sovereignties similar sentiments have hitherto prevailed among all orders and denominations of men among us to all general purposes we have uniformly been one people each individual citizen everywhere enjoying the same national rights privileges and protection as a nation we have made peace and war as a nation we have vanquished our common enemies as a nation we have formed alliances and made treaties and entered into various compacts and conventions with foreign states a strong sense of the value and blessings of union induced the people at a very early period to institute a federal government to preserve and perpetuate it they formed it almost as soon as they had a political existence nay at a time when their habitations were in flames when many of their citizens were bleeding and when the progress of hostility and desolation left little room for those calm and mature inquiries and reflections which must ever precede the formation of a wise and wellbalanced government for a free people it is not to be wondered at that a government instituted in times so inauspicious should on experiment be found greatly deficient and inadequate to the purpose it was intended to answer this intelligent people perceived and regretted these defects still continuing no less attached to union than enamored of liberty they observed the danger which immediately threatened the former and more remotely the latter and being persuaded that ample security for both could only be found in a national government more wisely framed they as with one voice convened the late convention at philadelphia to take that important subject under consideration this convention composed of men who possessed the confidence of the people and many of whom had become highly distinguished by their patriotism virtue and wisdom in times which tried the minds and hearts of men undertook the arduous task in the mild season of peace with minds unoccupied by other subjects they passed many months in cool uninterrupted and daily consultation and finally without having been awed by power or influenced by any passions except love for their country they presented and recommended to the people the plan produced by their joint and very unanimous councils admit for so is the fact that this plan is only recommended not imposed yet let it be remembered that it is neither recommended to blind approbation nor to blind reprobation but to that sedate and candid consideration which the magnitude and importance of the subject demand and which it certainly ought to receive but this as was remarked in the foregoing number of this paper is more to be wished than expected that it may be so considered and examined experience on a former occasion teaches us not to be too sanguine in such hopes it is not yet forgotten that wellgrounded apprehensions of imminent danger induced the people of america to form the memorable congress of 1774 that body recommended certain measures to their constituents and the event proved their wisdom yet it is fresh in our memories how soon the press began to teem with pamphlets and weekly papers against those very measures not only many of the officers of government who obeyed the dictates of personal interest but others from a mistaken estimate of consequences or the undue influence of former attachments or whose ambition aimed at objects which did not correspond with the public good were indefatigable in their efforts to persuade the people to reject the advice of that patriotic congress many indeed were deceived and deluded but the great majority of the people reasoned and decided judiciously and happy they are in reflecting that they did so they considered that the congress was composed of many wise and experienced men that being convened from different parts of the country they brought with them and communicated to each other a variety of useful information that in the course of the time they passed together in inquiring into and discussing the true interests of their country they must have acquired very accurate knowledge on that head that they were individually interested in the public liberty and prosperity and therefore that it was not less their inclination than their duty to recommend only such measures as after the most mature deliberation they really thought prudent and advisable these and similar considerations then induced the people to rely greatly on the judgment and integrity of the congress and they took their advice notwithstanding the various arts and endeavors used to deter them from it but if the people at large had reason to confide in the men of that congress few of whom had been fully tried or generally known still greater reason have they now to respect the judgment and advice of the convention for it is well known that some of the most distinguished members of that congress who have been since tried and justly approved for patriotism and abilities and who have grown old in acquiring political information were also members of this convention and carried into it their accumulated knowledge and experience it is worthy of remark that not only the first but every succeeding congress as well as the late convention have invariably joined with the people in thinking that the prosperity of america depended on its union to preserve and perpetuate it was the great object of the people in forming that convention and it is also the great object of the plan which the convention has advised them to adopt with what propriety therefore or for what good purposes are attempts at this particular period made by some men to depreciate the importance of the union or why is it suggested that three or four confederacies would be better than one i am persuaded in my own mind that the people have always thought right on this subject and that their universal and uniform attachment to the cause of the union rests on great and weighty reasons which i shall endeavor to develop and explain in some ensuing papers they who promote the idea of substituting a number of distinct confederacies in the room of the plan of the convention seem clearly to foresee that the rejection of it would put the continuance of the union in the utmost jeopardy that certainly would be the case and i sincerely wish that it may be as clearly foreseen by every good citizen that whenever the dissolution of the union arrives america will have reason to exclaim in the words of the poet farewell a long farewell to all my greatness it is not a new observation that the people of any country if like the americans intelligent and wellinformed seldom adopt and steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion respecting their interests that consideration naturally tends to create great respect for the high opinion which the people of america have so long and uniformly entertained of the importance of their continuing firmly united under one federal government vested with sufficient powers for all general and national purposes the more attentively i consider and investigate the reasons which appear to have given birth to this opinion the more i become convinced that they are cogent and conclusive among the many objects to which a wise and free people find it necessary to direct their attention that of providing for their safety seems to be the first the safety of the people doubtless has relation to a great variety of circumstances and considerations and consequently affords great latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and comprehensively at present i mean only to consider it as it respects security for the preservation of peace and tranquillity as well as against dangers from foreign arms and influence as from dangers of the like kind arising from domestic causes as the former of these comes first in order it is proper it should be the first discussed let us therefore proceed to examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a cordial union under an efficient national government affords them the best security that can be devised against hostilities from abroad the number of wars which have happened or will happen in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the number and weight of the causes whether real or pretended which provoke or invite them if this remark be just it becomes useful to inquire whether so many just causes of war are likely to be given by united america as by disunited america for if it should turn out that united america will probably give the fewest then it will follow that in this respect the union tends most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other nations the just causes of war for the most part arise either from violation of treaties or from direct violence america has already formed treaties with no less than six foreign nations and all of them except prussia are maritime and therefore able to annoy and injure us she has also extensive commerce with portugal spain and britain and with respect to the two latter has in addition the circumstance of neighborhood to attend to it is of high importance to the peace of america that she observe the laws of nations towards all these powers and to me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and punctually done by one national government than it could be either by thirteen separate states or by three or four distinct confederacies because when once an efficient national government is established the best men in the country will not only consent to serve but also will generally be appointed to manage it for although town or country or other contracted influence may place men in state assemblies or senates or courts of justice or executive departments yet more general and extensive reputation for talents and other qualifications will be necessary to recommend men to offices under the national governmentespecially as it will have the widest field for choice and never experience that want of proper persons which is not uncommon in some of the states hence it will result that the administration the political counsels and the judicial decisions of the national government will be more wise systematical and judicious than those of individual states and consequently more satisfactory with respect to other nations as well as more safe with respect to us because under the national government treaties and articles of treaties as well as the laws of nations will always be expounded in one sense and executed in the same mannerwhereas adjudications on the same points and questions in thirteen states or in three or four confederacies will not always accord or be consistent and that as well from the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by different and independent governments as from the different local laws and interests which may affect and influence them the wisdom of the convention in committing such questions to the jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible only to one national government cannot be too much commended because the prospect of present loss or advantage may often tempt the governing party in one or two states to swerve from good faith and justice but those temptations not reaching the other states and consequently having little or no influence on the national government the temptation will be fruitless and good faith and justice be preserved the case of the treaty of peace with britain adds great weight to this reasoning because even if the governing party in a state should be disposed to resist such temptations yet as such temptations may and commonly do result from circumstances peculiar to the state and may affect a great number of the inhabitants the governing party may not always be able if willing to prevent the injustice meditated or to punish the aggressors but the national government not being affected by those local circumstances will neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves nor want power or inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others so far therefore as either designed or accidental violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford just causes of war they are less to be apprehended under one general government than under several lesser ones and in that respect the former most favors the safety of the people as to those just causes of war which proceed from direct and unlawful violence it appears equally clear to me that one good national government affords vastly more security against dangers of that sort than can be derived from any other quarter because such violences are more frequently caused by the passions and interests of a part than of the whole of one or two states than of the union not a single indian war has yet been occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government feeble as it is but there are several instances of indian hostilities having been provoked by the improper conduct of individual states who either unable or unwilling to restrain or punish offenses have given occasion to the slaughter of many innocent inhabitants the neighborhood of spanish and british territories bordering on some states and not on others naturally confines the causes of quarrel more immediately to the borderers the bordering states if any will be those who under the impulse of sudden irritation and a quick sense of apparent interest or injury will be most likely by direct violence to excite war with these nations and nothing can so effectually obviate that danger as a national government whose wisdom and prudence will not be diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately interested but not only fewer just causes of war will be given by the national government but it will also be more in their power to accommodate and settle them amicably they will be more temperate and cool and in that respect as well as in others will be more in capacity to act advisedly than the offending state the pride of states as well as of men naturally disposes them to justify all their actions and opposes their acknowledging correcting or repairing their errors and offenses the national government in such cases will not be affected by this pride but will proceed with moderation and candor to consider and decide on the means most proper to extricate them from the difficulties which threaten them besides it is well known that acknowledgments explanations and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory from a strong united nation which would be rejected as unsatisfactory if offered by a state or confederacy of little consideration or power in the year 1685 the state of genoa having offended louis xiv endeavored to appease him he demanded that they should send their doge or chief magistrate accompanied by four of their senators to france to ask his pardon and receive his terms they were obliged to submit to it for the sake of peace would he on any occasion either have demanded or have received the like humiliation from spain or britain or any other powerful nation my last paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the people would be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to by just causes of war given to other nations and those reasons show that such causes would not only be more rarely given but would also be more easily accommodated by a national government than either by the state governments or the proposed little confederacies but the safety of the people of america against dangers from foreign force depends not only on their forbearing to give just causes of war to other nations but also on their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not to invite hostility or insult for it need not be observed that there are pretended as well as just causes of war it is too true however disgraceful it may be to human nature that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it nay absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it but for the purposes and objects merely personal such as thirst for military glory revenge for personal affronts ambition or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans these and a variety of other motives which affect only the mind of the sovereign often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people but independent of these inducements to war which are more prevalent in absolute monarchies but which well deserve our attention there are others which affect nations as often as kings and some of them will on examination be found to grow out of our relative situation and circumstances with france and with britain we are rivals in the fisheries and can supply their markets cheaper than they can themselves notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties on their own or duties on foreign fish with them and with most other european nations we are rivals in navigation and the carrying trade and we shall deceive ourselves if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it flourish for as our carrying trade cannot increase without in some degree diminishing theirs it is more their interest and will be more their policy to restrain than to promote it in the trade to china and india we interfere with more than one nation inasmuch as it enables us to partake in advantages which they had in a manner monopolized and as we thereby supply ourselves with commodities which we used to purchase from them the extension of our own commerce in our own vessels cannot give pleasure to any nations who possess territories on or near this continent because the cheapness and excellence of our productions added to the circumstance of vicinity and the enterprise and address of our merchants and navigators will give us a greater share in the advantages which those territories afford than consists with the wishes or policy of their respective sovereigns spain thinks it convenient to shut the mississippi against us on the one side and britain excludes us from the saint lawrence on the other nor will either of them permit the other waters which are between them and us to become the means of mutual intercourse and traffic from these and such like considerations which might if consistent with prudence be more amplified and detailed it is easy to see that jealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide into the minds and cabinets of other nations and that we are not to expect that they should regard our advancement in union in power and consequence by land and by sea with an eye of indifference and composure the people of america are aware that inducements to war may arise out of these circumstances as well as from others not so obvious at present and that whenever such inducements may find fit time and opportunity for operation pretenses to color and justify them will not be wanting wisely therefore do they consider union and a good national government as necessary to put and keep them in such a situation as instead of inviting war will tend to repress and discourage it that situation consists in the best possible state of defense and necessarily depends on the government the arms and the resources of the country as the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole and cannot be provided for without government either one or more or many let us inquire whether one good government is not relative to the object in question more competent than any other given number whatever one government can collect and avail itself of the talents and experience of the ablest men in whatever part of the union they may be found it can move on uniform principles of policy it can harmonize assimilate and protect the several parts and members and extend the benefit of its foresight and precautions to each in the formation of treaties it will regard the interest of the whole and the particular interests of the parts as connected with that of the whole it can apply the resources and power of the whole to the defense of any particular part and that more easily and expeditiously than state governments or separate confederacies can possibly do for want of concert and unity of system it can place the militia under one plan of discipline and by putting their officers in a proper line of subordination to the chief magistrate will as it were consolidate them into one corps and thereby render them more efficient than if divided into thirteen or into three or four distinct independent companies what would the militia of britain be if the english militia obeyed the government of england if the scotch militia obeyed the government of scotland and if the welsh militia obeyed the government of wales suppose an invasion would those three governments if they agreed at all be able with all their respective forces to operate against the enemy so effectually as the single government of great britain would we have heard much of the fleets of britain and the time may come if we are wise when the fleets of america may engage attention but if one national government had not so regulated the navigation of britain as to make it a nursery for seamenif one national government had not called forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets their prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated let england have its navigation and fleetlet scotland have its navigation and fleetlet wales have its navigation and fleetlet ireland have its navigation and fleetlet those four of the constituent parts of the british empire be be under four independent governments and it is easy to perceive how soon they would each dwindle into comparative insignificance apply these facts to our own case leave america divided into thirteen or if you please into three or four independent governmentswhat armies could they raise and paywhat fleets could they ever hope to have if one was attacked would the others fly to its succor and spend their blood and money in its defense would there be no danger of their being flattered into neutrality by its specious promises or seduced by a too great fondness for peace to decline hazarding their tranquillity and present safety for the sake of neighbors of whom perhaps they have been jealous and whose importance they are content to see diminished although such conduct would not be wise it would nevertheless be natural the history of the states of greece and of other countries abounds with such instances and it is not improbable that what has so often happened would under similar circumstances happen again but admit that they might be willing to help the invaded state or confederacy how and when and in what proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded who shall command the allied armies and from which of them shall he receive his orders who shall settle the terms of peace and in case of disputes what umpire shall decide between them and compel acquiescence various difficulties and inconveniences would be inseparable from such a situation whereas one government watching over the general and common interests and combining and directing the powers and resources of the whole would be free from all these embarrassments and conduce far more to the safety of the people but whatever may be our situation whether firmly united under one national government or split into a number of confederacies certain it is that foreign nations will know and view it exactly as it is and they will act toward us accordingly if they see that our national government is efficient and well administered our trade prudently regulated our militia properly organized and disciplined our resources and finances discreetly managed our credit reestablished our people free contented and united they will be much more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke our resentment if on the other hand they find us either destitute of an effectual government each state doing right or wrong as to its rulers may seem convenient or split into three or four independent and probably discordant republics or confederacies one inclining to britain another to france and a third to spain and perhaps played off against each other by the three what a poor pitiful figure will america make in their eyes how liable would she become not only to their contempt but to their outrage and how soon would dearbought experience proclaim that when a people or family so divide it never fails to be against themselves queen anne in her letter of the 1st july 1706 to the scotch parliament makes some observations on the importance of the union then forming between england and scotland which merit our attention i shall present the public with one or two extracts from it an entire and perfect union will be the solid foundation of lasting peace it will secure your religion liberty and property remove the animosities amongst yourselves and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms it must increase your strength riches and trade and by this union the whole island being joined in affection and free from all apprehensions of different interest will be enabled to resist all its enemies we most earnestly recommend to you calmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair that the union may be brought to a happy conclusion being the only effectual way to secure our present and future happiness and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies who will doubtless on this occasion use their utmost endeavors to prevent or delay this union it was remarked in the preceding paper that weakness and divisions at home would invite dangers from abroad and that nothing would tend more to secure us from them than union strength and good government within ourselves this subject is copious and cannot easily be exhausted the history of great britain is the one with which we are in general the best acquainted and it gives us many useful lessons we may profit by their experience without paying the price which it cost them although it seems obvious to common sense that the people of such an island should be but one nation yet we find that they were for ages divided into three and that those three were almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars with one another notwithstanding their true interest with respect to the continental nations was really the same yet by the arts and policy and practices of those nations their mutual jealousies were perpetually kept inflamed and for a long series of years they were far more inconvenient and troublesome than they were useful and assisting to each other should the people of america divide themselves into three or four nations would not the same thing happen would not similar jealousies arise and be in like manner cherished instead of their being joined in affection and free from all apprehension of different interests envy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection and the partial interests of each confederacy instead of the general interests of all america would be the only objects of their policy and pursuits hence like most other bordering nations they would always be either involved in disputes and war or live in the constant apprehension of them the most sanguine advocates for three or four confederacies cannot reasonably suppose that they would long remain exactly on an equal footing in point of strength even if it was possible to form them so at first but admitting that to be practicable yet what human contrivance can secure the continuance of such equality independent of those local circumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one part and to impede its progress in another we must advert to the effects of that superior policy and good management which would probably distinguish the government of one above the rest and by which their relative equality in strength and consideration would be destroyed for it cannot be presumed that the same degree of sound policy prudence and foresight would uniformly be observed by each of these confederacies for a long succession of years whenever and from whatever causes it might happen and happen it would that any one of these nations or confederacies should rise on the scale of political importance much above the degree of her neighbors that moment would those neighbors behold her with envy and with fear both those passions would lead them to countenance if not to promote whatever might promise to diminish her importance and would also restrain them from measures calculated to advance or even to secure her prosperity much time would not be necessary to enable her to discern these unfriendly dispositions she would soon begin not only to lose confidence in her neighbors but also to feel a disposition equally unfavorable to them distrust naturally creates distrust and by nothing is goodwill and kind conduct more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies and uncandid imputations whether expressed or implied the north is generally the region of strength and many local circumstances render it probable that the most northern of the proposed confederacies would at a period not very distant be unquestionably more formidable than any of the others no sooner would this become evident than the northern hive would excite the same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of america which it formerly did in the southern parts of europe nor does it appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might often be tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors they who well consider the history of similar divisions and confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that those in contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than as they would be borderers that they would neither love nor trust one another but on the contrary would be a prey to discord jealousy and mutual injuries in short that they would place us exactly in the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to see us viz formidable only to each other from these considerations it appears that those gentlemen are greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances offensive and defensive might be formed between these confederacies and would produce that combination and union of wills of arms and of resources which would be necessary to put and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign enemies when did the independent states into which britain and spain were formerly divided combine in such alliance or unite their forces against a foreign enemy the proposed confederacies will be distinct nations each of them would have its commerce with foreigners to regulate by distinct treaties and as their productions and commodities are different and proper for different markets so would those treaties be essentially different different commercial concerns must create different interests and of course different degrees of political attachment to and connection with different foreign nations hence it might and probably would happen that the foreign nation with whom the southern confederacy might be at war would be the one with whom the northern confederacy would be the most desirous of preserving peace and friendship an alliance so contrary to their immediate interest would not therefore be easy to form nor if formed would it be observed and fulfilled with perfect good faith nay it is far more probable that in america as in europe neighboring nations acting under the impulse of opposite interests and unfriendly passions would frequently be found taking different sides considering our distance from europe it would be more natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger from one another than from distant nations and therefore that each of them should be more desirous to guard against the others by the aid of foreign alliances than to guard against foreign dangers by alliances between themselves and here let us not forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our ports and foreign armies into our country than it is to persuade or compel them to depart how many conquests did the romans and others make in the characters of allies and what innovations did they under the same character introduce into the governments of those whom they pretended to protect let candid men judge then whether the division of america into any given number of independent sovereignties would tend to secure us against the hostilities and improper interference of foreign nations it is a just and not a new observation that enemies to particular persons and opponents to particular measures seldom confine their censures to such things only in either as are worthy of blame unless on this principle it is difficult to explain the motives of their conduct who condemn the proposed constitution in the aggregate and treat with severity some of the most unexceptionable articles in it the second section gives power to the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur the power of making treaties is an important one especially as it relates to war peace and commerce and it should not be delegated but in such a mode and with such precautions as will afford the highest security that it will be exercised by men the best qualified for the purpose and in the manner most conducive to the public good the convention appears to have been attentive to both these points they have directed the president to be chosen by select bodies of electors to be deputed by the people for that express purpose and they have committed the appointment of senators to the state legislatures this mode has in such cases vastly the advantage of elections by the people in their collective capacity where the activity of party zeal taking the advantage of the supineness the ignorance and the hopes and fears of the unwary and interested often places men in office by the votes of a small proportion of the electors as the select assemblies for choosing the president as well as the state legislatures who appoint the senators will in general be composed of the most enlightened and respectable citizens there is reason to presume that their attention and their votes will be directed to those men only who have become the most distinguished by their abilities and virtue and in whom the people perceive just grounds for confidence the constitution manifests very particular attention to this object by excluding men under thirtyfive from the first office and those under thirty from the second it confines the electors to men of whom the people have had time to form a judgment and with respect to whom they will not be liable to be deceived by those brilliant appearances of genius and patriotism which like transient meteors sometimes mislead as well as dazzle if the observation be well founded that wise kings will always be served by able ministers it is fair to argue that as an assembly of select electors possess in a greater degree than kings the means of extensive and accurate information relative to men and characters so will their appointments bear at least equal marks of discretion and discernment the inference which naturally results from these considerations is this that the president and senators so chosen will always be of the number of those who best understand our national interests whether considered in relation to the several states or to foreign nations who are best able to promote those interests and whose reputation for integrity inspires and merits confidence with such men the power of making treaties may be safely lodged although the absolute necessity of system in the conduct of any business is universally known and acknowledged yet the high importance of it in national affairs has not yet become sufficiently impressed on the public mind they who wish to commit the power under consideration to a popular assembly composed of members constantly coming and going in quick succession seem not to recollect that such a body must necessarily be inadequate to the attainment of those great objects which require to be steadily contemplated in all their relations and circumstances and which can only be approached and achieved by measures which not only talents but also exact information and often much time are necessary to concert and to execute it was wise therefore in the convention to provide not only that the power of making treaties should be committed to able and honest men but also that they should continue in place a sufficient time to become perfectly acquainted with our national concerns and to form and introduce a a system for the management of them the duration prescribed is such as will give them an opportunity of greatly extending their political information and of rendering their accumulating experience more and more beneficial to their country nor has the convention discovered less prudence in providing for the frequent elections of senators in such a way as to obviate the inconvenience of periodically transferring those great affairs entirely to new men for by leaving a considerable residue of the old ones in place uniformity and order as well as a constant succession of official information will be preserved there are a few who will not admit that the affairs of trade and navigation should be regulated by a system cautiously formed and steadily pursued and that both our treaties and our laws should correspond with and be made to promote it it is of much consequence that this correspondence and conformity be carefully maintained and they who assent to the truth of this position will see and confess that it is well provided for by making concurrence of the senate necessary both to treaties and to laws it seldom happens in the negotiation of treaties of whatever nature but that perfect secrecy and immediate despatch are sometimes requisite these are cases where the most useful intelligence may be obtained if the persons possessing it can be relieved from apprehensions of discovery those apprehensions will operate on those persons whether they are actuated by mercenary or friendly motives and there doubtless are many of both descriptions who would rely on the secrecy of the president but who would not confide in that of the senate and still less in that of a large popular assembly the convention have done well therefore in so disposing of the power of making treaties that although the president must in forming them act by the advice and consent of the senate yet he will be able to manage the business of intelligence in such a manner as prudence may suggest they who have turned their attention to the affairs of men must have perceived that there are tides in them tides very irregular in their duration strength and direction and seldom found to run twice exactly in the same manner or measure to discern and to profit by these tides in national affairs is the business of those who preside over them and they who have had much experience on this head inform us that there frequently are occasions when days nay even when hours are precious the loss of a battle the death of a prince the removal of a minister or other circumstances intervening to change the present posture and aspect of affairs may turn the most favorable tide into a course opposite to our wishes as in the field so in the cabinet there are moments to be seized as they pass and they who preside in either should be left in capacity to improve them so often and so essentially have we heretofore suffered from the want of secrecy and despatch that the constitution would have been inexcusably defective if no attention had been paid to those objects those matters which in negotiations usually require the most secrecy and the most despatch are those preparatory and auxiliary measures which are not otherwise important in a national view than as they tend to facilitate the attainment of the objects of the negotiation for these the president will find no difficulty to provide and should any circumstance occur which requires the advice and consent of the senate he may at any time convene them thus we see that the constitution provides that our negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage which can be derived from talents information integrity and deliberate investigations on the one hand and from secrecy and despatch on the other but to this plan as to most others that have ever appeared objections are contrived and urged some are displeased with it not on account of any errors or defects in it but because as the treaties when made are to have the force of laws they should be made only by men invested with legislative authority these gentlemen seem not to consider that the judgments of our courts and the commissions constitutionally given by our governor are as valid and as binding on all persons whom they concern as the laws passed by our legislature all constitutional acts of power whether in the executive or in the judicial department have as much legal validity and obligation as if they proceeded from the legislature and therefore whatever name be given to the power of making treaties or however obligatory they may be when made certain it is that the people may with much propriety commit the power to a distinct body from the legislature the executive or the judicial it surely does not follow that because they have given the power of making laws to the legislature that therefore they should likewise give them the power to do every other act of sovereignty by which the citizens are to be bound and affected others though content that treaties should be made in the mode proposed are averse to their being the supreme laws of the land they insist and profess to believe that treaties like acts of assembly should be repealable at pleasure this idea seems to be new and peculiar to this country but new errors as well as new truths often appear these gentlemen would do well to reflect that a treaty is only another name for a bargain and that it would be impossible to find a nation who would make any bargain with us which should be binding on them absolutely but on us only so long and so far as we may think proper to be bound by it they who make laws may without doubt amend or repeal them and it will not be disputed that they who make treaties may alter or cancel them but still let us not forget that treaties are made not by only one of the contracting parties but by both and consequently that as the consent of both was essential to their formation at first so must it ever afterwards be to alter or cancel them the proposed constitution therefore has not in the least extended the obligation of treaties they are just as binding and just as far beyond the lawful reach of legislative acts now as they will be at any future period or under any form of government however useful jealousy may be in republics yet when like bile in the natural it abounds too much in the body politic the eyes of both become very liable to be deceived by the delusive appearances which that malady casts on surrounding objects from this cause probably proceed the fears and apprehensions of some that the president and senate may make treaties without an equal eye to the interests of all the states others suspect that two thirds will oppress the remaining third and ask whether those gentlemen are made sufficiently responsible for their conduct whether if they act corruptly they can be punished and if they make disadvantageous treaties how are we to get rid of those treaties as all the states are equally represented in the senate and by men the most able and the most willing to promote the interests of their constituents they will all have an equal degree of influence in that body especially while they continue to be careful in appointing proper persons and to insist on their punctual attendance in proportion as the united states assume a national form and a national character so will the good of the whole be more and more an object of attention and the government must be a weak one indeed if it should forget that the good of the whole can only be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members which compose the whole it will not be in the power of the president and senate to make any treaties by which they and their families and estates will not be equally bound and affected with the rest of the community and having no private interests distinct from that of the nation they will be under no temptations to neglect the latter as to corruption the case is not supposable he must either have been very unfortunate in his intercourse with the world or possess a heart very susceptible of such impressions who can think it probable that the president and two thirds of the senate will ever be capable of such unworthy conduct the idea is too gross and too invidious to be entertained but in such a case if it should ever happen the treaty so obtained from us would like all other fraudulent contracts be null and void by the law of nations with respect to their responsibility it is difficult to conceive how it could be increased every consideration that can influence the human mind such as honor oaths reputations conscience the love of country and family affections and attachments afford security for their fidelity in short as the constitution has taken the utmost care that they shall be men of talents and integrity we have reason to be persuaded that the treaties they make will be as advantageous as all circumstances considered could be made and so far as the fear of punishment and disgrace can operate that motive to good behavior is amply afforded by the article on the subject of impeachments
