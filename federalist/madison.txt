among the numerous advantages promised by a well constructed union none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction the friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice he will not fail therefore to set a due value on any plan which without violating the principles to which he is attached provides a proper cure for it the instability injustice and confusion introduced into the public councils have in truth been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished as they continue to be the favorite and fruitful topics from which the adversaries to liberty derive their most specious declamations the valuable improvements made by the american constitutions on the popular models both ancient and modern cannot certainly be too much admired but it would be an unwarrantable partiality to contend that they have as effectually obviated the danger on this side as was wished and expected complaints are everywhere heard from our most considerate and virtuous citizens equally the friends of public and private faith and of public and personal liberty that our governments are too unstable that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties and that measures are too often decided not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority however anxiously we may wish that these complaints had no foundation the evidence of known facts will not permit us to deny that they are in some degree true it will be found indeed on a candid review of our situation that some of the distresses under which we labor have been erroneously charged on the operation of our governments but it will be found at the same time that other causes will not alone account for many of our heaviest misfortunes and particularly for that prevailing and increasing distrust of public engagements and alarm for private rights which are echoed from one end of the continent to the other these must be chiefly if not wholly effects of the unsteadiness and injustice with which a factious spirit has tainted our public administrations by a faction i understand a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest adversed to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction the one by removing its causes the other by controlling its effects there are again two methods of removing the causes of faction the one by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence the other by giving to every citizen the same opinions the same passions and the same interests it could never be more truly said than of the first remedy that it was worse than the disease liberty is to faction what air is to fire an aliment without which it instantly expires but it could not be less folly to abolish liberty which is essential to political life because it nourishes faction than it would be to wish the annihilation of air which is essential to animal life because it imparts to fire its destructive agency the second expedient is as impracticable as the first would be unwise as long as the reason of man continues fallible and he is at liberty to exercise it different opinions will be formed as long as the connection subsists between his reason and his selflove his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves the diversity in the faculties of men from which the rights of property originate is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests the protection of these faculties is the first object of government from the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity according to the different circumstances of civil society a zeal for different opinions concerning religion concerning government and many other points as well of speculation as of practice an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for preeminence and power or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions have in turn divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to cooperate for their common good so strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts but the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society those who are creditors and those who are debtors fall under a like discrimination a landed interest a manufacturing interest a mercantile interest a moneyed interest with many lesser interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes actuated by different sentiments and views the regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause because his interest would certainly bias his judgment and not improbably corrupt his integrity with equal nay with greater reason a body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation but so many judicial determinations not indeed concerning the rights of single persons but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens and what are the different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the causes which they determine is a law proposed concerning private debts it is a question to which the creditors are parties on one side and the debtors on the other justice ought to hold the balance between them yet the parties are and must be themselves the judges and the most numerous party or in other words the most powerful faction must be expected to prevail shall domestic manufactures be encouraged and in what degree by restrictions on foreign manufactures are questions which would be differently decided by the landed and the manufacturing classes and probably by neither with a sole regard to justice and the public good the apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality yet there is perhaps no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice every shilling with which they overburden the inferior number is a shilling saved to their own pockets it is in vain to say that enlightened statesmen will be able to adjust these clashing interests and render them all subservient to the public good enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm nor in many cases can such an adjustment be made at all without taking into view indirect and remote considerations which will rarely prevail over the immediate interest which one party may find in disregarding the rights of another or the good of the whole the inference to which we are brought is that the causes of faction cannot be removed and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects if a faction consists of less than a majority relief is supplied by the republican principle which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote it may clog the administration it may convulse the society but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the constitution when a majority is included in a faction the form of popular government on the other hand enables it to sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens to secure the public good and private rights against the danger of such a faction and at the same time to preserve the spirit and the form of popular government is then the great object to which our inquiries are directed let me add that it is the great desideratum by which this form of government can be rescued from the opprobrium under which it has so long labored and be recommended to the esteem and adoption of mankind by what means is this object attainable evidently by one of two only either the existence of the same passion or interest in a majority at the same time must be prevented or the majority having such coexistent passion or interest must be rendered by their number and local situation unable to concert and carry into effect schemes of oppression if the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control they are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together that is in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful from this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy by which i mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens who assemble and administer the government in person can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction a common passion or interest will in almost every case be felt by a majority of the whole a communication and concert result from the form of government itself and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of government have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions their opinions and their passions a republic by which i mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place opens a different prospect and promises the cure for which we are seeking let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure and the efficacy which it must derive from the union the two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are first the delegation of the government in the latter to a small number of citizens elected by the rest secondly the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended the effect of the first difference is on the one hand to refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations under such a regulation it may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves convened for the purpose on the other hand the effect may be inverted men of factious tempers of local prejudices or of sinister designs may by intrigue by corruption or by other means first obtain the suffrages and then betray the interests of the people the question resulting is whether small or extensive republics are more favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public weal and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two obvious considerations in the first place it is to be remarked that however small the republic may be the representatives must be raised to a certain number in order to guard against the cabals of a few and that however large it may be they must be limited to a certain number in order to guard against the confusion of a multitude hence the number of representatives in the two cases not being in proportion to that of the two constituents and being proportionally greater in the small republic it follows that if the proportion of fit characters be not less in the large than in the small republic the former will present a greater option and consequently a greater probability of a fit choice in the next place as each representative will be chosen by a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small republic it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice with success the vicious arts by which elections are too often carried and the suffrages of the people being more free will be more likely to centre in men who possess the most attractive merit and the most diffusive and established characters it must be confessed that in this as in most other cases there is a mean on both sides of which inconveniences will be found to lie by enlarging too much the number of electors you render the representatives too little acquainted with all their local circumstances and lesser interests as by reducing it too much you render him unduly attached to these and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and national objects the federal constitution forms a happy combination in this respect the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national the local and particular to the state legislatures the other point of difference is the greater number of citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within the compass of republican than of democratic government and it is this circumstance principally which renders factious combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the latter the smaller the society the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it the fewer the distinct parties and interests the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority and the smaller the compass within which they are placed the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens or if such a common motive exists it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other besides other impediments it may be remarked that where there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes communication is always checked by distrust in proportion to the number whose concurrence is necessary hence it clearly appears that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy in controlling the effects of faction is enjoyed by a large over a small republicis enjoyed by the union over the states composing it does the advantage consist in the substitution of representatives whose enlightened views and virtuous sentiments render them superior to local prejudices and schemes of injustice it will not be denied that the representation of the union will be most likely to possess these requisite endowments does it consist in the greater security afforded by a greater variety of parties against the event of any one party being able to outnumber and oppress the rest in an equal degree does the increased variety of parties comprised within the union increase this security does it in fine consist in the greater obstacles opposed to the concert and accomplishment of the secret wishes of an unjust and interested majority here again the extent of the union gives it the most palpable advantage the influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states a religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the confederacy but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source a rage for paper money for an abolition of debts for an equal division of property or for any other improper or wicked project will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the union than a particular member of it in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district than an entire state in the extent and proper structure of the union therefore we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government and according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of federalists we have seen the necessity of the union as our bulwark against foreign danger as the conservator of peace among ourselves as the guardian of our commerce and other common interests as the only substitute for those military establishments which have subverted the liberties of the old world and as the proper antidote for the diseases of faction which have proved fatal to other popular governments and of which alarming symptoms have been betrayed by our own all that remains within this branch of our inquiries is to take notice of an objection that may be drawn from the great extent of country which the union embraces a few observations on this subject will be the more proper as it is perceived that the adversaries of the new constitution are availing themselves of the prevailing prejudice with regard to the practicable sphere of republican administration in order to supply by imaginary difficulties the want of those solid objections which they endeavor in vain to find the error which limits republican government to a narrow district has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers i remark here only that it seems to owe its rise and prevalence chiefly to the confounding of a republic with a democracy applying to the former reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter the true distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a former occasion it is that in a democracy the people meet and exercise the government in person in a republic they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents a democracy consequently will be confined to a small spot a republic may be extended over a large region to this accidental source of the error may be added the artifice of some celebrated authors whose writings have had a great share in forming the modern standard of political opinions being subjects either of an absolute or limited monarchy they have endeavored to heighten the advantages or palliate the evils of those forms by placing in comparison the vices and defects of the republican and by citing as specimens of the latter the turbulent democracies of ancient greece and modern italy under the confusion of names it has been an easy task to transfer to a republic observations applicable to a democracy only and among others the observation that it can never be established but among a small number of people living within a small compass of territory such a fallacy may have been the less perceived as most of the popular governments of antiquity were of the democratic species and even in modern europe to which we owe the great principle of representation no example is seen of a government wholly popular and founded at the same time wholly on that principle if europe has the merit of discovering this great mechanical power in government by the simple agency of which the will of the largest political body may be concentred and its force directed to any object which the public good requires america can claim the merit of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive republics it is only to be lamented that any of her citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit of displaying its full efficacy in the establishment of the comprehensive system now under her consideration as the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from the central point which will just permit the most remote citizens to assemble as often as their public functions demand and will include no greater number than can join in those functions so the natural limit of a republic is that distance from the centre which will barely allow the representatives to meet as often as may be necessary for the administration of public affairs can it be said that the limits of the united states exceed this distance it will not be said by those who recollect that the atlantic coast is the longest side of the union that during the term of thirteen years the representatives of the states have been almost continually assembled and that the members from the most distant states are not chargeable with greater intermissions of attendance than those from the states in the neighborhood of congress that we may form a juster estimate with regard to this interesting subject let us resort to the actual dimensions of the union the limits as fixed by the treaty of peace are on the east the atlantic on the south the latitude of thirtyone degrees on the west the mississippi and on the north an irregular line running in some instances beyond the fortyfifth degree in others falling as low as the fortysecond the southern shore of lake erie lies below that latitude computing the distance between the thirtyfirst and fortyfifth degrees it amounts to nine hundred and seventythree common miles computing it from thirtyone to fortytwo degrees to seven hundred and sixtyfour miles and a half taking the mean for the distance the amount will be eight hundred and sixtyeight miles and threefourths the mean distance from the atlantic to the mississippi does not probably exceed seven hundred and fifty miles on a comparison of this extent with that of several countries in europe the practicability of rendering our system commensurate to it appears to be demonstrable it is not a great deal larger than germany where a diet representing the whole empire is continually assembled or than poland before the late dismemberment where another national diet was the depositary of the supreme power passing by france and spain we find that in great britain inferior as it may be in size the representatives of the northern extremity of the island have as far to travel to the national council as will be required of those of the most remote parts of the union favorable as this view of the subject may be some observations remain which will place it in a light still more satisfactory in the first place it is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects which concern all the members of the republic but which are not to be attained by the separate provisions of any the subordinate governments which can extend their care to all those other subjects which can be separately provided for will retain their due authority and activity were it proposed by the plan of the convention to abolish the governments of the particular states its adversaries would have some ground for their objection though it would not be difficult to show that if they were abolished the general government would be compelled by the principle of selfpreservation to reinstate them in their proper jurisdiction a second observation to be made is that the immediate object of the federal constitution is to secure the union of the thirteen primitive states which we know to be practicable and to add to them such other states as may arise in their own bosoms or in their neighborhoods which we cannot doubt to be equally practicable the arrangements that may be necessary for those angles and fractions of our territory which lie on our northwestern frontier must be left to those whom further discoveries and experience will render more equal to the task let it be remarked in the third place that the intercourse throughout the union will be facilitated by new improvements roads will everywhere be shortened and kept in better order accommodations for travelers will be multiplied and meliorated an interior navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout or nearly throughout the whole extent of the thirteen states the communication between the western and atlantic districts and between different parts of each will be rendered more and more easy by those numerous canals with which the beneficence of nature has intersected our country and which art finds it so little difficult to connect and complete a fourth and still more important consideration is that as almost every state will on one side or other be a frontier and will thus find in regard to its safety an inducement to make some sacrifices for the sake of the general protection so the states which lie at the greatest distance from the heart of the union and which of course may partake least of the ordinary circulation of its benefits will be at the same time immediately contiguous to foreign nations and will consequently stand on particular occasions in greatest need of its strength and resources it may be inconvenient for georgia or the states forming our western or northeastern borders to send their representatives to the seat of government but they would find it more so to struggle alone against an invading enemy or even to support alone the whole expense of those precautions which may be dictated by the neighborhood of continual danger if they should derive less benefit therefore from the union in some respects than the less distant states they will derive greater benefit from it in other respects and thus the proper equilibrium will be maintained throughout i submit to you my fellowcitizens these considerations in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect and that you will never suffer difficulties however formidable in appearance or however fashionable the error on which they may be founded to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scene into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of america knit together as they are by so many cords of affection can no longer live together as members of the same family can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness can no longer be fellow citizens of one great respectable and flourishing empire hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish no my countrymen shut your ears against this unhallowed language shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys the kindred blood which flows in the veins of american citizens the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their sacred rights consecrate their union and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens rivals enemies and if novelties are to be shunned believe me the most alarming of all novelties the most wild of all projects the most rash of all attempts is that of rendering us in pieces in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness but why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected merely because it may comprise what is new is it not the glory of the people of america that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity for custom or for names to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense the knowledge of their own situation and the lessons of their own experience to this manly spirit posterity will be indebted for the possession and the world for the example of the numerous innovations displayed on the american theatre in favor of private rights and public happiness had no important step been taken by the leaders of the revolution for which a precedent could not be discovered no government established of which an exact model did not present itself the people of the united states might at this moment have been numbered among the melancholy victims of misguided councils must at best have been laboring under the weight of some of those forms which have crushed the liberties of the rest of mankind happily for america happily we trust for the whole human race they pursued a new and more noble course they accomplished a revolution which has no parallel in the annals of human society they reared the fabrics of governments which have no model on the face of the globe they formed the design of a great confederacy which it is incumbent on their successors to improve and perpetuate if their works betray imperfections we wonder at the fewness of them if they erred most in the structure of the union this was the work most difficult to be executed this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and to decide in reviewing the defects of the existing confederation and showing that they cannot be supplied by a government of less energy than that before the public several of the most important principles of the latter fell of course under consideration but as the ultimate object of these papers is to determine clearly and fully the merits of this constitution and the expediency of adopting it our plan cannot be complete without taking a more critical and thorough survey of the work of the convention without examining it on all its sides comparing it in all its parts and calculating its probable effects that this remaining task may be executed under impressions conducive to a just and fair result some reflections must in this place be indulged which candor previously suggests it is a misfortune inseparable from human affairs that public measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation which is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance or obstruct the public good and that this spirit is more apt to be diminished than promoted by those occasions which require an unusual exercise of it to those who have been led by experience to attend to this consideration it could not appear surprising that the act of the convention which recommends so many important changes and innovations which may be viewed in so many lights and relations and which touches the springs of so many passions and interests should find or excite dispositions unfriendly both on one side and on the other to a fair discussion and accurate judgment of its merits in some it has been too evident from their own publications that they have scanned the proposed constitution not only with a predisposition to censure but with a predetermination to condemn as the language held by others betrays an opposite predetermination or bias which must render their opinions also of little moment in the question in placing however these different characters on a level with respect to the weight of their opinions i wish not to insinuate that there may not be a material difference in the purity of their intentions it is but just to remark in favor of the latter description that as our situation is universally admitted to be peculiarly critical and to require indispensably that something should be done for our relief the predetermined patron of what has been actually done may have taken his bias from the weight of these considerations as well as from considerations of a sinister nature the predetermined adversary on the other hand can have been governed by no venial motive whatever the intentions of the first may be upright as they may on the contrary be culpable the views of the last cannot be upright and must be culpable but the truth is that these papers are not addressed to persons falling under either of these characters they solicit the attention of those only who add to a sincere zeal for the happiness of their country a temper favorable to a just estimate of the means of promoting it persons of this character will proceed to an examination of the plan submitted by the convention not only without a disposition to find or to magnify faults but will see the propriety of reflecting that a faultless plan was not to be expected nor will they barely make allowances for the errors which may be chargeable on the fallibility to which the convention as a body of men were liable but will keep in mind that they themselves also are but men and ought not to assume an infallibility in rejudging the fallible opinions of others with equal readiness will it be perceived that besides these inducements to candor many allowances ought to be made for the difficulties inherent in the very nature of the undertaking referred to the convention the novelty of the undertaking immediately strikes us it has been shown in the course of these papers that the existing confederation is founded on principles which are fallacious that we must consequently change this first foundation and with it the superstructure resting upon it it has been shown that the other confederacies which could be consulted as precedents have been vitiated by the same erroneous principles and can therefore furnish no other light than that of beacons which give warning of the course to be shunned without pointing out that which ought to be pursued the most that the convention could do in such a situation was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other countries as well as of our own and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors as future experiences may unfold them among the difficulties encountered by the convention a very important one must have lain in combining the requisite stability and energy in government with the inviolable attention due to liberty and to the republican form without substantially accomplishing this part of their undertaking they would have very imperfectly fulfilled the object of their appointment or the expectation of the public yet that it could not be easily accomplished will be denied by no one who is unwilling to betray his ignorance of the subject energy in government is essential to that security against external and internal danger and to that prompt and salutary execution of the laws which enter into the very definition of good government stability in government is essential to national character and to the advantages annexed to it as well as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people which are among the chief blessings of civil society an irregular and mutable legislation is not more an evil in itself than it is odious to the people and it may be pronounced with assurance that the people of this country enlightened as they are with regard to the nature and interested as the great body of them are in the effects of good government will never be satisfied till some remedy be applied to the vicissitudes and uncertainties which characterize the state administrations on comparing however these valuable ingredients with the vital principles of liberty we must perceive at once the difficulty of mingling them together in their due proportions the genius of republican liberty seems to demand on one side not only that all power should be derived from the people but that those intrusted with it should be kept in independence on the people by a short duration of their appointments and that even during this short period the trust should be placed not in a few but a number of hands stability on the contrary requires that the hands in which power is lodged should continue for a length of time the same a frequent change of men will result from a frequent return of elections and a frequent change of measures from a frequent change of men whilst energy in government requires not only a certain duration of power but the execution of it by a single hand how far the convention may have succeeded in this part of their work will better appear on a more accurate view of it from the cursory view here taken it must clearly appear to have been an arduous part not less arduous must have been the task of marking the proper line of partition between the authority of the general and that of the state governments every man will be sensible of this difficulty in proportion as he has been accustomed to contemplate and discriminate objects extensive and complicated in their nature the faculties of the mind itself have never yet been distinguished and defined with satisfactory precision by all the efforts of the most acute and metaphysical philosophers sense perception judgment desire volition memory imagination are found to be separated by such delicate shades and minute gradations that their boundaries have eluded the most subtle investigations and remain a pregnant source of ingenious disquisition and controversy the boundaries between the great kingdom of nature and still more between the various provinces and lesser portions into which they are subdivided afford another illustration of the same important truth the most sagacious and laborious naturalists have never yet succeeded in tracing with certainty the line which separates the district of vegetable life from the neighboring region of unorganized matter or which marks the termination of the former and the commencement of the animal empire a still greater obscurity lies in the distinctive characters by which the objects in each of these great departments of nature have been arranged and assorted when we pass from the works of nature in which all the delineations are perfectly accurate and appear to be otherwise only from the imperfection of the eye which surveys them to the institutions of man in which the obscurity arises as well from the object itself as from the organ by which it is contemplated we must perceive the necessity of moderating still further our expectations and hopes from the efforts of human sagacity experience has instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet been able to discriminate and define with sufficient certainty its three great provinces the legislative executive and judiciary or even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches questions daily occur in the course of practice which prove the obscurity which reins in these subjects and which puzzle the greatest adepts in political science the experience of ages with the continued and combined labors of the most enlightened legislatures and jurists has been equally unsuccessful in delineating the several objects and limits of different codes of laws and different tribunals of justice the precise extent of the common law and the statute law the maritime law the ecclesiastical law the law of corporations and other local laws and customs remains still to be clearly and finally established in great britain where accuracy in such subjects has been more industriously pursued than in any other part of the world the jurisdiction of her several courts general and local of law of equity of admiralty etc is not less a source of frequent and intricate discussions sufficiently denoting the indeterminate limits by which they are respectively circumscribed all new laws though penned with the greatest technical skill and passed on the fullest and most mature deliberation are considered as more or less obscure and equivocal until their meaning be liquidated and ascertained by a series of particular discussions and adjudications besides the obscurity arising from the complexity of objects and the imperfection of the human faculties the medium through which the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment the use of words is to express ideas perspicuity therefore requires not only that the ideas should be distinctly formed but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them but no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea or so correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas hence it must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in themselves and however accurately the discrimination may be considered the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered and this unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less according to the complexity and novelty of the objects defined when the almighty himself condescends to address mankind in their own language his meaning luminous as it must be is rendered dim and doubtful by the cloudy medium through which it is communicated here then are three sources of vague and incorrect definitions indistinctness of the object imperfection of the organ of conception inadequateness of the vehicle of ideas any one of these must produce a certain degree of obscurity the convention in delineating the boundary between the federal and state jurisdictions must have experienced the full effect of them all to the difficulties already mentioned may be added the interfering pretensions of the larger and smaller states we cannot err in supposing that the former would contend for a participation in the government fully proportioned to their superior wealth and importance and that the latter would not be less tenacious of the equality at present enjoyed by them we may well suppose that neither side would entirely yield to the other and consequently that the struggle could be terminated only by compromise it is extremely probable also that after the ratio of representation had been adjusted this very compromise must have produced a fresh struggle between the same parties to give such a turn to the organization of the government and to the distribution of its powers as would increase the importance of the branches in forming which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence there are features in the constitution which warrant each of these suppositions and as far as either of them is well founded it shows that the convention must have been compelled to sacrifice theoretical propriety to the force of extraneous considerations nor could it have been the large and small states only which would marshal themselves in opposition to each other on various points other combinations resulting from a difference of local position and policy must have created additional difficulties as every state may be divided into different districts and its citizens into different classes which give birth to contending interests and local jealousies so the different parts of the united states are distinguished from each other by a variety of circumstances which produce a like effect on a larger scale and although this variety of interests for reasons sufficiently explained in a former paper may have a salutary influence on the administration of the government when formed yet every one must be sensible of the contrary influence which must have been experienced in the task of forming it would it be wonderful if under the pressure of all these difficulties the convention should have been forced into some deviations from that artificial structure and regular symmetry which an abstract view of the subject might lead an ingenious theorist to bestow on a constitution planned in his closet or in his imagination the real wonder is that so many difficulties should have been surmounted and surmounted with a unanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have been unexpected it is impossible for any man of candor to reflect on this circumstance without partaking of the astonishment it is impossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a finger of that almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution we had occasion in a former paper to take notice of the repeated trials which have been unsuccessfully made in the united netherlands for reforming the baneful and notorious vices of their constitution the history of almost all the great councils and consultations held among mankind for reconciling their discordant opinions assuaging their mutual jealousies and adjusting their respective interests is a history of factions contentions and disappointments and may be classed among the most dark and degraded pictures which display the infirmities and depravities of the human character if in a few scattered instances a brighter aspect is presented they serve only as exceptions to admonish us of the general truth and by their lustre to darken the gloom of the adverse prospect to which they are contrasted in revolving the causes from which these exceptions result and applying them to the particular instances before us we are necessarily led to two important conclusions the first is that the convention must have enjoyed in a very singular degree an exemption from the pestilential influence of party animosities the disease most incident to deliberative bodies and most apt to contaminate their proceedings the second conclusion is that all the deputations composing the convention were satisfactorily accommodated by the final act or were induced to accede to it by a deep conviction of the necessity of sacrificing private opinions and partial interests to the public good and by a despair of seeing this necessity diminished by delays or by new experiments it is not a little remarkable that in every case reported by ancient history in which government has been established with deliberation and consent the task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly of men but has been performed by some individual citizen of preeminent wisdom and approved integrity minos we learn was the primitive founder of the government of crete as zaleucus was of that of the locrians theseus first and after him draco and solon instituted the government of athens lycurgus was the lawgiver of sparta the foundation of the original government of rome was laid by romulus and the work completed by two of his elective successors numa and tullius hostilius on the abolition of royalty the consular administration was substituted by brutus who stepped forward with a project for such a reform which he alleged had been prepared by tullius hostilius and to which his address obtained the assent and ratification of the senate and people this remark is applicable to confederate governments also amphictyon we are told was the author of that which bore his name the achaean league received its first birth from achaeus and its second from aratus what degree of agency these reputed lawgivers might have in their respective establishments or how far they might be clothed with the legitimate authority of the people cannot in every instance be ascertained in some however the proceeding was strictly regular draco appears to have been intrusted by the people of athens with indefinite powers to reform its government and laws and solon according to plutarch was in a manner compelled by the universal suffrage of his fellowcitizens to take upon him the sole and absolute power of newmodeling the constitution the proceedings under lycurgus were less regular but as far as the advocates for a regular reform could prevail they all turned their eyes towards the single efforts of that celebrated patriot and sage instead of seeking to bring about a revolution by the intervention of a deliberative body of citizens whence could it have proceeded that a people jealous as the greeks were of their liberty should so far abandon the rules of caution as to place their destiny in the hands of a single citizen whence could it have proceeded that the athenians a people who would not suffer an army to be commanded by fewer than ten generals and who required no other proof of danger to their liberties than the illustrious merit of a fellowcitizen should consider one illustrious citizen as a more eligible depositary of the fortunes of themselves and their posterity than a select body of citizens from whose common deliberations more wisdom as well as more safety might have been expected these questions cannot be fully answered without supposing that the fears of discord and disunion among a number of counsellors exceeded the apprehension of treachery or incapacity in a single individual history informs us likewise of the difficulties with which these celebrated reformers had to contend as well as the expedients which they were obliged to employ in order to carry their reforms into effect solon who seems to have indulged a more temporizing policy confessed that he had not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their happiness but most tolerable to their prejudices and lycurgus more true to his object was under the necessity of mixing a portion of violence with the authority of superstition and of securing his final success by a voluntary renunciation first of his country and then of his life if these lessons teach us on one hand to admire the improvement made by america on the ancient mode of preparing and establishing regular plans of government they serve not less on the other to admonish us of the hazards and difficulties incident to such experiments and of the great imprudence of unnecessarily multiplying them is it an unreasonable conjecture that the errors which may be contained in the plan of the convention are such as have resulted rather from the defect of antecedent experience on this complicated and difficult subject than from a want of accuracy or care in the investigation of it and consequently such as will not be ascertained until an actual trial shall have pointed them out this conjecture is rendered probable not only by many considerations of a general nature but by the particular case of the articles of confederation it is observable that among the numerous objections and amendments suggested by the several states when these articles were submitted for their ratification not one is found which alludes to the great and radical error which on actual trial has discovered itself and if we except the observations which new jersey was led to make rather by her local situation than by her peculiar foresight it may be questioned whether a single suggestion was of sufficient moment to justify a revision of the system there is abundant reason nevertheless to suppose that immaterial as these objections were they would have been adhered to with a very dangerous inflexibility in some states had not a zeal for their opinions and supposed interests been stifled by the more powerful sentiment of selfpreservation one state we may remember persisted for several years in refusing her concurrence although the enemy remained the whole period at our gates or rather in the very bowels of our country nor was her pliancy in the end effected by a less motive than the fear of being chargeable with protracting the public calamities and endangering the event of the contest every candid reader will make the proper reflections on these important facts a patient who finds his disorder daily growing worse and that an efficacious remedy can no longer be delayed without extreme danger after coolly revolving his situation and the characters of different physicians selects and calls in such of them as he judges most capable of administering relief and best entitled to his confidence the physicians attend the case of the patient is carefully examined a consultation is held they are unanimously agreed that the symptoms are critical but that the case with proper and timely relief is so far from being desperate that it may be made to issue in an improvement of his constitution they are equally unanimous in prescribing the remedy by which this happy effect is to be produced the prescription is no sooner made known however than a number of persons interpose and without denying the reality or danger of the disorder assure the patient that the prescription will be poison to his constitution and forbid him under pain of certain death to make use of it might not the patient reasonably demand before he ventured to follow this advice that the authors of it should at least agree among themselves on some other remedy to be substituted and if he found them differing as much from one another as from his first counsellors would he not act prudently in trying the experiment unanimously recommended by the latter rather than be hearkening to those who could neither deny the necessity of a speedy remedy nor agree in proposing one such a patient and in such a situation is america at this moment she has been sensible of her malady she has obtained a regular and unanimous advice from men of her own deliberate choice and she is warned by others against following this advice under pain of the most fatal consequences do the monitors deny the reality of her danger no do they deny the necessity of some speedy and powerful remedy no are they agreed are any two of them agreed in their objections to the remedy proposed or in the proper one to be substituted let them speak for themselves this one tells us that the proposed constitution ought to be rejected because it is not a confederation of the states but a government over individuals another admits that it ought to be a government over individuals to a certain extent but by no means to the extent proposed a third does not object to the government over individuals or to the extent proposed but to the want of a bill of rights a fourth concurs in the absolute necessity of a bill of rights but contends that it ought to be declaratory not of the personal rights of individuals but of the rights reserved to the states in their political capacity a fifth is of opinion that a bill of rights of any sort would be superfluous and misplaced and that the plan would be unexceptionable but for the fatal power of regulating the times and places of election an objector in a large state exclaims loudly against the unreasonable equality of representation in the senate an objector in a small state is equally loud against the dangerous inequality in the house of representatives from this quarter we are alarmed with the amazing expense from the number of persons who are to administer the new government from another quarter and sometimes from the same quarter on another occasion the cry is that the congress will be but a shadow of a representation and that the government would be far less objectionable if the number and the expense were doubled a patriot in a state that does not import or export discerns insuperable objections against the power of direct taxation the patriotic adversary in a state of great exports and imports is not less dissatisfied that the whole burden of taxes may be thrown on consumption this politician discovers in the constitution a direct and irresistible tendency to monarchy that is equally sure it will end in aristocracy another is puzzled to say which of these shapes it will ultimately assume but sees clearly it must be one or other of them whilst a fourth is not wanting who with no less confidence affirms that the constitution is so far from having a bias towards either of these dangers that the weight on that side will not be sufficient to keep it upright and firm against its opposite propensities with another class of adversaries to the constitution the language is that the legislative executive and judiciary departments are intermixed in such a manner as to contradict all the ideas of regular government and all the requisite precautions in favor of liberty whilst this objection circulates in vague and general expressions there are but a few who lend their sanction to it let each one come forward with his particular explanation and scarce any two are exactly agreed upon the subject in the eyes of one the junction of the senate with the president in the responsible function of appointing to offices instead of vesting this executive power in the executive alone is the vicious part of the organization to another the exclusion of the house of representatives whose numbers alone could be a due security against corruption and partiality in the exercise of such a power is equally obnoxious with another the admission of the president into any share of a power which ever must be a dangerous engine in the hands of the executive magistrate is an unpardonable violation of the maxims of republican jealousy no part of the arrangement according to some is more inadmissible than the trial of impeachments by the senate which is alternately a member both of the legislative and executive departments when this power so evidently belonged to the judiciary department we concur fully reply others in the objection to this part of the plan but we can never agree that a reference of impeachments to the judiciary authority would be an amendment of the error our principal dislike to the organization arises from the extensive powers already lodged in that department even among the zealous patrons of a council of state the most irreconcilable variance is discovered concerning the mode in which it ought to be constituted the demand of one gentleman is that the council should consist of a small number to be appointed by the most numerous branch of the legislature another would prefer a larger number and considers it as a fundamental condition that the appointment should be made by the president himself as it can give no umbrage to the writers against the plan of the federal constitution let us suppose that as they are the most zealous so they are also the most sagacious of those who think the late convention were unequal to the task assigned them and that a wiser and better plan might and ought to be substituted let us further suppose that their country should concur both in this favorable opinion of their merits and in their unfavorable opinion of the convention and should accordingly proceed to form them into a second convention with full powers and for the express purpose of revising and remoulding the work of the first were the experiment to be seriously made though it required some effort to view it seriously even in fiction i leave it to be decided by the sample of opinions just exhibited whether with all their enmity to their predecessors they would in any one point depart so widely from their example as in the discord and ferment that would mark their own deliberations and whether the constitution now before the public would not stand as fair a chance for immortality as lycurgus gave to that of sparta by making its change to depend on his own return from exile and death if it were to be immediately adopted and were to continue in force not until a better but until another should be agreed upon by this new assembly of lawgivers it is a matter both of wonder and regret that those who raise so many objections against the new constitution should never call to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it it is not necessary that the former should be perfect it is sufficient that the latter is more imperfect no man would refuse to give brass for silver or gold because the latter had some alloy in it no man would refuse to quit a shattered and tottering habitation for a firm and commodious building because the latter had not a porch to it or because some of the rooms might be a little larger or smaller or the ceilings a little higher or lower than his fancy would have planned them but waiving illustrations of this sort is it not manifest that most of the capital objections urged against the new system lie with tenfold weight against the existing confederation is an indefinite power to raise money dangerous in the hands of the federal government the present congress can make requisitions to any amount they please and the states are constitutionally bound to furnish them they can emit bills of credit as long as they will pay for the paper they can borrow both abroad and at home as long as a shilling will be lent is an indefinite power to raise troops dangerous the confederation gives to congress that power also and they have already begun to make use of it is it improper and unsafe to intermix the different powers of government in the same body of men congress a single body of men are the sole depositary of all the federal powers is it particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treasury and the command of the army into the same hands the confederation places them both in the hands of congress is a bill of rights essential to liberty the confederation has no bill of rights is it an objection against the new constitution that it empowers the senate with the concurrence of the executive to make treaties which are to be the laws of the land the existing congress without any such control can make treaties which they themselves have declared and most of the states have recognized to be the supreme law of the land is the importation of slaves permitted by the new constitution for twenty years by the old it is permitted forever i shall be told that however dangerous this mixture of powers may be in theory it is rendered harmless by the dependence of congress on the state for the means of carrying them into practice that however large the mass of powers may be it is in fact a lifeless mass then say i in the first place that the confederation is chargeable with the still greater folly of declaring certain powers in the federal government to be absolutely necessary and at the same time rendering them absolutely nugatory and in the next place that if the union is to continue and no better government be substituted effective powers must either be granted to or assumed by the existing congress in either of which events the contrast just stated will hold good but this is not all out of this lifeless mass has already grown an excrescent power which tends to realize all the dangers that can be apprehended from a defective construction of the supreme government of the union it is now no longer a point of speculation and hope that the western territory is a mine of vast wealth to the united states and although it is not of such a nature as to extricate them from their present distresses or for some time to come to yield any regular supplies for the public expenses yet must it hereafter be able under proper management both to effect a gradual discharge of the domestic debt and to furnish for a certain period liberal tributes to the federal treasury a very large proportion of this fund has been already surrendered by individual states and it may with reason be expected that the remaining states will not persist in withholding similar proofs of their equity and generosity we may calculate therefore that a rich and fertile country of an area equal to the inhabited extent of the united states will soon become a national stock congress have assumed the administration of this stock they have begun to render it productive congress have undertaken to do more they have proceeded to form new states to erect temporary governments to appoint officers for them and to prescribe the conditions on which such states shall be admitted into the confederacy all this has been done and done without the least color of constitutional authority yet no blame has been whispered no alarm has been sounded a great and independent fund of revenue is passing into the hands of a single body of men who can raise troops to an indefinite number and appropriate money to their support for an indefinite period of time and yet there are men who have not only been silent spectators of this prospect but who are advocates for the system which exhibits it and at the same time urge against the new system the objections which we have heard would they not act with more consistency in urging the establishment of the latter as no less necessary to guard the union against the future powers and resources of a body constructed like the existing congress than to save it from the dangers threatened by the present impotency of that assembly i mean not by any thing here said to throw censure on the measures which have been pursued by congress i am sensible they could not have done otherwise the public interest the necessity of the case imposed upon them the task of overleaping their constitutional limits but is not the fact an alarming proof of the danger resulting from a government which does not possess regular powers commensurate to its objects a dissolution or usurpation is the dreadful dilemma to which it is continually exposed the last paper having concluded the observations which were meant to introduce a candid survey of the plan of government reported by the convention we now proceed to the execution of that part of our undertaking the first question that offers itself is whether the general form and aspect of the government be strictly republican it is evident that no other form would be reconcilable with the genius of the people of america with the fundamental principles of the revolution or with that honorable determination which animates every votary of freedom to rest all our political experiments on the capacity of mankind for selfgovernment if the plan of the convention therefore be found to depart from the republican character its advocates must abandon it as no longer defensible what then are the distinctive characters of the republican form were an answer to this question to be sought not by recurring to principles but in the application of the term by political writers to the constitution of different states no satisfactory one would ever be found holland in which no particle of the supreme authority is derived from the people has passed almost universally under the denomination of a republic the same title has been bestowed on venice where absolute power over the great body of the people is exercised in the most absolute manner by a small body of hereditary nobles poland which is a mixture of aristocracy and of monarchy in their worst forms has been dignified with the same appellation the government of england which has one republican branch only combined with an hereditary aristocracy and monarchy has with equal impropriety been frequently placed on the list of republics these examples which are nearly as dissimilar to each other as to a genuine republic show the extreme inaccuracy with which the term has been used in political disquisitions if we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established we may define a republic to be or at least may bestow that name on a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure for a limited period or during good behavior it is essential to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society not from an inconsiderable proportion or a favored class of it otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers might aspire to the rank of republicans and claim for their government the honorable title of republic it is sufficient for such a government that the persons administering it be appointed either directly or indirectly by the people and that they hold their appointments by either of the tenures just specified otherwise every government in the united states as well as every other popular government that has been or can be well organized or well executed would be degraded from the republican character according to the constitution of every state in the union some or other of the officers of government are appointed indirectly only by the people according to most of them the chief magistrate himself is so appointed and according to one this mode of appointment is extended to one of the coordinate branches of the legislature according to all the constitutions also the tenure of the highest offices is extended to a definite period and in many instances both within the legislative and executive departments to a period of years according to the provisions of most of the constitutions again as well as according to the most respectable and received opinions on the subject the members of the judiciary department are to retain their offices by the firm tenure of good behavior on comparing the constitution planned by the convention with the standard here fixed we perceive at once that it is in the most rigid sense conformable to it the house of representatives like that of one branch at least of all the state legislatures is elected immediately by the great body of the people the senate like the present congress and the senate of maryland derives its appointment indirectly from the people the president is indirectly derived from the choice of the people according to the example in most of the states even the judges with all other officers of the union will as in the several states be the choice though a remote choice of the people themselves the duration of the appointments is equally conformable to the republican standard and to the model of state constitutions the house of representatives is periodically elective as in all the states and for the period of two years as in the state of south carolina the senate is elective for the period of six years which is but one year more than the period of the senate of maryland and but two more than that of the senates of new york and virginia the president is to continue in office for the period of four years as in new york and delaware the chief magistrate is elected for three years and in south carolina for two years in the other states the election is annual in several of the states however no constitutional provision is made for the impeachment of the chief magistrate and in delaware and virginia he is not impeachable till out of office the president of the united states is impeachable at any time during his continuance in office the tenure by which the judges are to hold their places is as it unquestionably ought to be that of good behavior the tenure of the ministerial offices generally will be a subject of legal regulation conformably to the reason of the case and the example of the state constitutions could any further proof be required of the republican complexion of this system the most decisive one might be found in its absolute prohibition of titles of nobility both under the federal and the state governments and in its express guaranty of the republican form to each of the latter but it was not sufficient say the adversaries of the proposed constitution for the convention to adhere to the republican form they ought with equal care to have preserved the federal form which regards the union as a confederacy of sovereign states instead of which they have framed a national government which regards the union as a consolidation of the states and it is asked by what authority this bold and radical innovation was undertaken the handle which has been made of this objection requires that it should be examined with some precision without inquiring into the accuracy of the distinction on which the objection is founded it will be necessary to a just estimate of its force first to ascertain the real character of the government in question secondly to inquire how far the convention were authorized to propose such a government and thirdly how far the duty they owed to their country could supply any defect of regular authority first in order to ascertain the real character of the government it may be considered in relation to the foundation on which it is to be established to the sources from which its ordinary powers are to be drawn to the operation of those powers to the extent of them and to the authority by which future changes in the government are to be introduced on examining the first relation it appears on one hand that the constitution is to be founded on the assent and ratification of the people of america given by deputies elected for the special purpose but on the other that this assent and ratification is to be given by the people not as individuals composing one entire nation but as composing the distinct and independent states to which they respectively belong it is to be the assent and ratification of the several states derived from the supreme authority in each state the authority of the people themselves the act therefore establishing the constitution will not be a national but a federal act that it will be a federal and not a national act as these terms are understood by the objectors the act of the people as forming so many independent states not as forming one aggregate nation is obvious from this single consideration that it is to result neither from the decision of a majority of the people of the union nor from that of a majority of the states it must result from the unanimous assent of the several states that are parties to it differing no otherwise from their ordinary assent than in its being expressed not by the legislative authority but by that of the people themselves were the people regarded in this transaction as forming one nation the will of the majority of the whole people of the united states would bind the minority in the same manner as the majority in each state must bind the minority and the will of the majority must be determined either by a comparison of the individual votes or by considering the will of the majority of the states as evidence of the will of a majority of the people of the united states neither of these rules have been adopted each state in ratifying the constitution is considered as a sovereign body independent of all others and only to be bound by its own voluntary act in this relation then the new constitution will if established be a federal and not a national constitution the next relation is to the sources from which the ordinary powers of government are to be derived the house of representatives will derive its powers from the people of america and the people will be represented in the same proportion and on the same principle as they are in the legislature of a particular state so far the government is national not federal the senate on the other hand will derive its powers from the states as political and coequal societies and these will be represented on the principle of equality in the senate as they now are in the existing congress so far the government is federal not national the executive power will be derived from a very compound source the immediate election of the president is to be made by the states in their political characters the votes allotted to them are in a compound ratio which considers them partly as distinct and coequal societies partly as unequal members of the same society the eventual election again is to be made by that branch of the legislature which consists of the national representatives but in this particular act they are to be thrown into the form of individual delegations from so many distinct and coequal bodies politic from this aspect of the government it appears to be of a mixed character presenting at least as many federal as national features the difference between a federal and national government as it relates to the operation of the government is supposed to consist in this that in the former the powers operate on the political bodies composing the confederacy in their political capacities in the latter on the individual citizens composing the nation in their individual capacities on trying the constitution by this criterion it falls under the national not the federal character though perhaps not so completely as has been understood in several cases and particularly in the trial of controversies to which states may be parties they must be viewed and proceeded against in their collective and political capacities only so far the national countenance of the government on this side seems to be disfigured by a few federal features but this blemish is perhaps unavoidable in any plan and the operation of the government on the people in their individual capacities in its ordinary and most essential proceedings may on the whole designate it in this relation a national government but if the government be national with regard to the operation of its powers it changes its aspect again when we contemplate it in relation to the extent of its powers the idea of a national government involves in it not only an authority over the individual citizens but an indefinite supremacy over all persons and things so far as they are objects of lawful government among a people consolidated into one nation this supremacy is completely vested in the national legislature among communities united for particular purposes it is vested partly in the general and partly in the municipal legislatures in the former case all local authorities are subordinate to the supreme and may be controlled directed or abolished by it at pleasure in the latter the local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy no more subject within their respective spheres to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them within its own sphere in this relation then the proposed government cannot be deemed a national one since its jurisdiction extends to certain enumerated objects only and leaves to the several states a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects it is true that in controversies relating to the boundary between the two jurisdictions the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be established under the general government but this does not change the principle of the case the decision is to be impartially made according to the rules of the constitution and all the usual and most effectual precautions are taken to secure this impartiality some such tribunal is clearly essential to prevent an appeal to the sword and a dissolution of the compact and that it ought to be established under the general rather than under the local governments or to speak more properly that it could be safely established under the first alone is a position not likely to be combated if we try the constitution by its last relation to the authority by which amendments are to be made we find it neither wholly national nor wholly federal were it wholly national the supreme and ultimate authority would reside in the majority of the people of the union and this authority would be competent at all times like that of a majority of every national society to alter or abolish its established government were it wholly federal on the other hand the concurrence of each state in the union would be essential to every alteration that would be binding on all the mode provided by the plan of the convention is not founded on either of these principles in requiring more than a majority and principles in requiring more than a majority and particularly in computing the proportion by states not by citizens it departs from the national and advances towards the federal character in rendering the concurrence of less than the whole number of states sufficient it loses again the federal and partakes of the national character the proposed constitution therefore is in strictness neither a national nor a federal constitution but a composition of both in its foundation it is federal not national in the sources from which the ordinary powers of the government are drawn it is partly federal and partly national in the operation of these powers it is national not federal in the extent of them again it is federal not national and finally in the authoritative mode of introducing amendments it is neither wholly federal nor wholly national the second point to be examined is whether the convention were authorized to frame and propose this mixed constitution the powers of the convention ought in strictness to be determined by an inspection of the commissions given to the members by their respective constituents as all of these however had reference either to the recommendation from the meeting at annapolis in september 1786 or to that from congress in february 1787 it will be sufficient to recur to these particular acts the act from annapolis recommends the appointment of commissioners to take into consideration the situation of the united states to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union and to report such an act for that purpose to the united states in congress assembled as when agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the legislature of every state will effectually provide for the same the recommendatory act of congress is in the words following whereas there is provision in the articles of confederation and perpetual union for making alterations therein by the assent of a congress of the united states and of the legislatures of the several states and whereas experience hath evinced that there are defects in the present confederation as a mean to remedy which several of the states and particularly the state of new york by express instructions to their delegates in congress have suggested a convention for the purposes expressed in the following resolution and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean of establishing in these states a firm national government resolved that in the opinion of congress it is expedient that on the second monday of may next a convention of delegates who shall have been appointed by the several states be held at philadelphia for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation and reporting to congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in congress and confirmed by the states render the federal constitution adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union from these two acts it appears 1st that the object of the convention was to establish in these states a firm national government 2d that this government was to be such as would be adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the union 3d that these purposes were to be effected by alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation as it is expressed in the act of congress or by such further provisions as should appear necessary as it stands in the recommendatory act from annapolis 4th that the alterations and provisions were to be reported to congress and to the states in order to be agreed to by the former and confirmed by the latter from a comparison and fair construction of these several modes of expression is to be deduced the authority under which the convention acted they were to frame a national government adequate to the exigencies of government and of the union and to reduce the articles of confederation into such form as to accomplish these purposes there are two rules of construction dictated by plain reason as well as founded on legal axioms the one is that every part of the expression ought if possible to be allowed some meaning and be made to conspire to some common end the other is that where the several parts cannot be made to coincide the less important should give way to the more important part the means should be sacrificed to the end rather than the end to the means suppose then that the expressions defining the authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with each other that a national and adequate government could not possibly in the judgment of the convention be affected by alterations and provisions in the articles of confederation which part of the definition ought to have been embraced and which rejected which was the more important which the less important part which the end which the means let the most scrupulous expositors of delegated powers let the most inveterate objectors against those exercised by the convention answer these questions let them declare whether it was of most importance to the happiness of the people of america that the articles of confederation should be disregarded and an adequate government be provided and the union preserved or that an adequate government should be omitted and the articles of confederation preserved let them declare whether the preservation of these articles was the end for securing which a reform of the government was to be introduced as the means or whether the establishment of a government adequate to the national happiness was the end at which these articles themselves originally aimed and to which they ought as insufficient means to have been sacrificed but is it necessary to suppose that these expressions are absolutely irreconcilable to each other that no alterations or provisions in the articles of the confederation could possibly mould them into a national and adequate government into such a government as has been proposed by the convention no stress it is presumed will in this case be laid on the title a change of that could never be deemed an exercise of ungranted power alterations in the body of the instrument are expressly authorized new provisions therein are also expressly authorized here then is a power to change the title to insert new articles to alter old ones must it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed so long as a part of the old articles remain those who maintain the affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between authorized and usurped innovations between that degree of change which lies within the compass of alterations and further provisions and that which amounts to a transmutation of the government will it be said that the alterations ought not to have touched the substance of the confederation the states would never have appointed a convention with so much solemnity nor described its objects with so much latitude if some substantial reform had not been in contemplation will it be said that the fundamental principles of the confederation were not within the purview of the convention and ought not to have been varied i ask what are these principles do they require that in the establishment of the constitution the states should be regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns they are so regarded by the constitution proposed do they require that the members of the government should derive their appointment from the legislatures not from the people of the states one branch of the new government is to be appointed by these legislatures and under the confederation the delegates to congress may all be appointed immediately by the people and in two states1 are actually so appointed do they require that the powers of the government should act on the states and not immediately on individuals in some instances as has been shown the powers of the new government will act on the states in their collective characters in some instances also those of the existing government act immediately on individuals in cases of capture of piracy of the post office of coins weights and measures of trade with the indians of claims under grants of land by different states and above all in the case of trials by courtsmarshal in the army and navy by which death may be inflicted without the intervention of a jury or even of a civil magistrate in all these cases the powers of the confederation operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual citizens do these fundamental principles require particularly that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of the states the confederation itself authorizes a direct tax to a certain extent on the post office the power of coinage has been so construed by congress as to levy a tribute immediately from that source also but pretermitting these instances was it not an acknowledged object of the convention and the universal expectation of the people that the regulation of trade should be submitted to the general government in such a form as would render it an immediate source of general revenue had not congress repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the confederation had not every state but one had not new york herself so far complied with the plan of congress as to recognize the principle of the innovation do these principles in fine require that the powers of the general government should be limited and that beyond this limit the states should be left in possession of their sovereignty and independence we have seen that in the new government as in the old the general powers are limited and that the states in all unenumerated cases are left in the enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction the truth is that the great principles of the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of confederation the misfortune under the latter system has been that these principles are so feeble and confined as to justify all the charges of inefficiency which have been urged against it and to require a degree of enlargement which gives to the new system the aspect of an entire transformation of the old in one particular it is admitted that the convention have departed from the tenor of their commission instead of reporting a plan requiring the confirmation of the legislatures of all the states they have reported a plan which is to be confirmed by the people and may be carried into effect by nine states only it is worthy of remark that this objection though the most plausible has been the least urged in the publications which have swarmed against the convention the forbearance can only have proceeded from an irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting the fate of twelve states to the perverseness or corruption of a thirteenth from the example of inflexible opposition given by a majority of one sixtieth of the people of america to a measure approved and called for by the voice of twelve states comprising fiftynine sixtieths of the people an example still fresh in the memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt for the wounded honor and prosperity of his country as this objection therefore has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention i dismiss it without further observation the third point to be inquired into is how far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could have supplied any defect of regular authority in the preceding inquiries the powers of the convention have been analyzed and tried with the same rigor and by the same rules as if they had been real and final powers for the establishment of a constitution for the united states we have seen in what manner they have borne the trial even on that supposition it is time now to recollect that the powers were merely advisory and recommendatory that they were so meant by the states and so understood by the convention and that the latter have accordingly planned and proposed a constitution which is to be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is written unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is addressed this reflection places the subject in a point of view altogether different and will enable us to judge with propriety of the course taken by the convention let us view the ground on which the convention stood it may be collected from their proceedings that they were deeply and unanimously impressed with the crisis which had led their country almost with one voice to make so singular and solemn an experiment for correcting the errors of a system by which this crisis had been produced that they were no less deeply and unanimously convinced that such a reform as they have proposed was absolutely necessary to effect the purposes of their appointment it could not be unknown to them that the hopes and expectations of the great body of citizens throughout this great empire were turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their deliberations they had every reason to believe that the contrary sentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and internal foe to the liberty and prosperity of the united states they had seen in the origin and progress of the experiment the alacrity with which the proposition made by a single state virginia towards a partial amendment of the confederation had been attended to and promoted they had seen the liberty assumed by a very few deputies from a very few states convened at annapolis of recommending a great and critical object wholly foreign to their commission not only justified by the public opinion but actually carried into effect by twelve out of the thirteen states they had seen in a variety of instances assumptions by congress not only of recommendatory but of operative powers warranted in the public estimation by occasions and objects infinitely less urgent than those by which their conduct was to be governed they must have reflected that in all great changes of established governments forms ought to give way to substance that a rigid adherence in such cases to the former would render nominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the people to abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness2 since it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to move in concert towards their object and it is therefore essential that such changes be instituted by some informal and unauthorized propositions made by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number of citizens they must have recollected that it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of proposing to the people plans for their safety and happiness that the states were first united against the danger with which they were threatened by their ancient government that committees and congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and defending their rights and that conventions were elected in the several states for establishing the constitutions under which they are now governed nor could it have been forgotten that no little illtimed scruples no zeal for adhering to ordinary forms were anywhere seen except in those who wished to indulge under these masks their secret enmity to the substance contended for they must have borne in mind that as the plan to be framed and proposed was to be submitted to the people themselves the disapprobation of this supreme authority would destroy it forever its approbation blot out antecedent errors and irregularities it might even have occurred to them that where a disposition to cavil prevailed their neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them and still more their recommendation of any measure whatever not warranted by their commission would not less excite animadversion than a recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the national exigencies had the convention under all these impressions and in the midst of all these considerations instead of exercising a manly confidence in their country by whose confidence they had been so peculiarly distinguished and of pointing out a system capable in their judgment of securing its happiness taken the cold and sullen resolution of disappointing its ardent hopes of sacrificing substance to forms of committing the dearest interests of their country to the uncertainties of delay and the hazard of events let me ask the man who can raise his mind to one elevated conception who can awaken in his bosom one patriotic emotion what judgment ought to have been pronounced by the impartial world by the friends of mankind by every virtuous citizen on the conduct and character of this assembly or if there be a man whose propensity to condemn is susceptible of no control let me then ask what sentence he has in reserve for the twelve states who usurped the power of sending deputies to the convention a body utterly unknown to their constitutions for congress who recommended the appointment of this body equally unknown to the confederation and for the state of new york in particular which first urged and then complied with this unauthorized interposition but that the objectors may be disarmed of every pretext it shall be granted for a moment that the convention were neither authorized by their commission nor justified by circumstances in proposing a constitution for their country does it follow that the constitution ought for that reason alone to be rejected if according to the noble precept it be lawful to accept good advice even from an enemy shall we set the ignoble example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our friends the prudent inquiry in all cases ought surely to be not so much from whom the advice comes as whether the advice be good the sum of what has been here advanced and proved is that the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers except in one instance little urged by the objectors has no foundation to support it that if they had exceeded their powers they were not only warranted but required as the confidential servants of their country by the circumstances in which they were placed to exercise the liberty which they assume and that finally if they had violated both their powers and their obligations in proposing a constitution this ought nevertheless to be embraced if it be calculated to accomplish the views and happiness of the people of america how far this character is due to the constitution is the subject under investigation the constitution proposed by the convention may be considered under two general points of view the first relates to the sum or quantity of power which it vests in the government including the restraints imposed on the states the second to the particular structure of the government and the distribution of this power among its several branches under the first view of the subject two important questions arise 1 whether any part of the powers transferred to the general government be unnecessary or improper 2 whether the entire mass of them be dangerous to the portion of jurisdiction left in the several states is the aggregate power of the general government greater than ought to have been vested in it this is the first question it cannot have escaped those who have attended with candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of the government that the authors of them have very little considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining a necessary end they have chosen rather to dwell on the inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all political advantages and on the possible abuses which must be incident to every power or trust of which a beneficial use can be made this method of handling the subject cannot impose on the good sense of the people of america it may display the subtlety of the writer it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and declamation it may inflame the passions of the unthinking and may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking but cool and candid people will at once reflect that the purest of human blessings must have a portion of alloy in them that the choice must always be made if not of the lesser evil at least of the greater not the perfect good and that in every political institution a power to advance the public happiness involves a discretion which may be misapplied and abused they will see therefore that in all cases where power is to be conferred the point first to be decided is whether such a power be necessary to the public good as the next will be in case of an affirmative decision to guard as effectually as possible against a perversion of the power to the public detriment that we may form a correct judgment on this subject it will be proper to review the several powers conferred on the government of the union and that this may be the more conveniently done they may be reduced into different classes as they relate to the following different objects 1 security against foreign danger 2 regulation of the intercourse with foreign nations 3 maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse among the states 4 certain miscellaneous objects of general utility 5 restraint of the states from certain injurious acts 6 provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers the powers falling within the first class are those of declaring war and granting letters of marque of providing armies and fleets of regulating and calling forth the militia of levying and borrowing money security against foreign danger is one of the primitive objects of civil society it is an avowed and essential object of the american union the powers requisite for attaining it must be effectually confided to the federal councils is the power of declaring war necessary no man will answer this question in the negative it would be superfluous therefore to enter into a proof of the affirmative the existing confederation establishes this power in the most ample form is the power of raising armies and equipping fleets necessary this is involved in the foregoing power it is involved in the power of selfdefense but was it necessary to give an indefinite power of raising troops as well as providing fleets and of maintaining both in peace as well as in war the answer to these questions has been too far anticipated in another place to admit an extensive discussion of them in this place the answer indeed seems to be so obvious and conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion in any place with what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense if a federal constitution could chain the ambition or set bounds to the exertions of all other nations then indeed might it prudently chain the discretion of its own government and set bounds to the exertions for its own safety how could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited unless we could prohibit in like manner the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation the means of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack they will in fact be ever determined by these rules and by no others it is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of selfpreservation it is worse than in vain because it plants in the constitution itself necessary usurpations of power every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied repetitions if one nation maintains constantly a disciplined army ready for the service of ambition or revenge it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions the fifteenth century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in the time of peace they were introduced by charles vii of france all europe has followed or been forced into the example had the example not been followed by other nations all europe must long ago have worn the chains of a universal monarch were every nation except france now to disband its peace establishments the same event might follow the veteran legions of rome were an overmatch for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her the mistress of the world not the less true is it that the liberties of rome proved the final victim to her military triumphs and that the liberties of europe as far as they ever existed have with few exceptions been the price of her military establishments a standing force therefore is a dangerous at the same time that it may be a necessary provision on the smallest scale it has its inconveniences on an extensive scale its consequences may be fatal on any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and precaution a wise nation will combine all these considerations and whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource which may become essential to its safety will exert all its prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties the clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the proposed constitution the union itself which it cements and secures destroys every pretext for a military establishment which could be dangerous america united with a handful of troops or without a single soldier exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than america disunited with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat it was remarked on a former occasion that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one nation in europe being rendered by her insular situation and her maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her neighbors the rulers of great britain have never been able by real or artificial dangers to cheat the public into an extensive peace establishment the distance of the united states from the powerful nations of the world gives them the same happy security a dangerous establishment can never be necessary or plausible so long as they continue a united people but let it never for a moment be forgotten that they are indebted for this advantage to the union alone the moment of its dissolution will be the date of a new order of things the fears of the weaker or the ambition of the stronger states or confederacies will set the same example in the new as charles vii did in the old world the example will be followed here from the same motives which produced universal imitation there instead of deriving from our situation the precious advantage which great britain has derived from hers the face of america will be but a copy of that of the continent of europe it will present liberty everywhere crushed between standing armies and perpetual taxes the fortunes of disunited america will be even more disastrous than those of europe the sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits no superior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her rival nations inflame their mutual animosities and render them the instruments of foreign ambition jealousy and revenge in america the miseries springing from her internal jealousies contentions and wars would form a part only of her lot a plentiful addition of evils would have their source in that relation in which europe stands to this quarter of the earth and which no other quarter of the earth bears to europe this picture of the consequences of disunion cannot be too highly colored or too often exhibited every man who loves peace every man who loves his country every man who loves liberty ought to have it ever before his eyes that he may cherish in his heart a due attachment to the union of america and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it next to the effectual establishment of the union the best possible precaution against danger from standing armies is a limitation of the term for which revenue may be appropriated to their support this precaution the constitution has prudently added i will not repeat here the observations which i flatter myself have placed this subject in a just and satisfactory light but it may not be improper to take notice of an argument against this part of the constitution which has been drawn from the policy and practice of great britain it is said that the continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual vote of the legislature whereas the american constitution has lengthened this critical period to two years this is the form in which the comparison is usually stated to the public but is it a just form is it a fair comparison does the british constitution restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year does the american impose on the congress appropriations for two years on the contrary it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy themselves that the british constitution fixes no limit whatever to the discretion of the legislature and that the american ties down the legislature to two years as the longest admissible term had the argument from the british example been truly stated it would have stood thus the term for which supplies may be appropriated to the army establishment though unlimited by the british constitution has nevertheless in practice been limited by parliamentary discretion to a single year now if in great britain where the house of commons is elected for seven years where so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small a proportion of the people where the electors are so corrupted by the representatives and the representatives so corrupted by the crown the representative body can possess a power to make appropriations to the army for an indefinite term without desiring or without daring to extend the term beyond a single year ought not suspicion herself to blush in pretending that the representatives of the united states elected freely by the whole body of the people every second year cannot be safely intrusted with the discretion over such appropriations expressly limited to the short period of two years a bad cause seldom fails to betray itself of this truth the management of the opposition to the federal government is an unvaried exemplification but among all the blunders which have been committed none is more striking than the attempt to enlist on that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the people of standing armies the attempt has awakened fully the public attention to that important subject and has led to investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal conviction not only that the constitution has provided the most effectual guards against danger from that quarter but that nothing short of a constitution fully adequate to the national defense and the preservation of the union can save america from as many standing armies as it may be split into states or confederacies and from such a progressive augmentation of these establishments in each as will render them as burdensome to the properties and ominous to the liberties of the people as any establishment that can become necessary under a united and efficient government must be tolerable to the former and safe to the latter the palpable necessity of the power to provide and maintain a navy has protected that part of the constitution against a spirit of censure which has spared few other parts it must indeed be numbered among the greatest blessings of america that as her union will be the only source of her maritime strength so this will be a principal source of her security against danger from abroad in this respect our situation bears another likeness to the insular advantage of great britain the batteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our safety are happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious government against our liberties the inhabitants of the atlantic frontier are all of them deeply interested in this provision for naval protection and if they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their beds if their property has remained safe against the predatory spirit of licentious adventurers if their maritime towns have not yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a conflagration by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden invaders these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of those from whom it claims allegiance but to causes that are fugitive and fallacious if we except perhaps virginia and maryland which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern frontiers no part of the union ought to feel more anxiety on this subject than new york her seacoast is extensive a very important district of the state is an island the state itself is penetrated by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues the great emporium of its commerce the great reservoir of its wealth lies every moment at the mercy of events and may almost be regarded as a hostage for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a foreign enemy or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and barbarians should a war be the result of the precarious situation of european affairs and all the unruly passions attending it be let loose on the ocean our escape from insults and depredations not only on that element but every part of the other bordering on it will be truly miraculous in the present condition of america the states more immediately exposed to these calamities have nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now exists and if their single resources were equal to the task of fortifying themselves against the danger the object to be protected would be almost consumed by the means of protecting them the power of regulating and calling forth the militia has been already sufficiently vindicated and explained the power of levying and borrowing money being the sinew of that which is to be exerted in the national defense is properly thrown into the same class with it this power also has been examined already with much attention and has i trust been clearly shown to be necessary both in the extent and form given to it by the constitution i will address one additional reflection only to those who contend that the power ought to have been restrained to externaltaxation by which they mean taxes on articles imported from other countries it cannot be doubted that this will always be a valuable source of revenue that for a considerable time it must be a principal source that at this moment it is an essential one but we may form very mistaken ideas on this subject if we do not call to mind in our calculations that the extent of revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary with the variations both in the extent and the kind of imports and that these variations do not correspond with the progress of population which must be the general measure of the public wants as long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor the importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers multiply as soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands not called for by agriculture the imported manufactures will decrease as the numbers of people increase in a more remote stage the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw materials which will be wrought into articles for exportation and will therefore require rather the encouragement of bounties than to be loaded with discouraging duties a system of government meant for duration ought to contemplate these revolutions and be able to accommodate itself to them some who have not denied the necessity of the power of taxation have grounded a very fierce attack against the constitution on the language in which it is defined it has been urged and echoed that the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general welfare no stronger proof could be given of the distress under which these writers labor for objections than their stooping to such a misconstruction had no other enumeration or definition of the powers of the congress been found in the constitution than the general expressions just cited the authors of the objection might have had some color for it though it would have been difficult to find a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to legislate in all possible cases a power to destroy the freedom of the press the trial by jury or even to regulate the course of descents or the forms of conveyances must be very singularly expressed by the terms to raise money for the general welfare but what color can the objection have when a specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms immediately follows and is not even separated by a longer pause than a semicolon if the different parts of the same instrument ought to be so expounded as to give meaning to every part which will bear it shall one part of the same sentence be excluded altogether from a share in the meaning and shall the more doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification whatsoever for what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but the idea of an enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the general meaning and can have no other effect than to confound and mislead is an absurdity which as we are reduced to the dilemma of charging either on the authors of the objection or on the authors of the constitution we must take the liberty of supposing had not its origin with the latter the objection here is the more extraordinary as it appears that the language used by the convention is a copy from the articles of confederation the objects of the union among the states as described in article third are their common defense security of their liberties and mutual and general welfare the terms of article eighth are still more identical all charges of war and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare and allowed by the united states in congress shall be defrayed out of a common treasury etc a similar language again occurs in article ninth construe either of these articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on the new constitution and they vest in the existing congress a power to legislate in all cases whatsoever but what would have been thought of that assembly if attaching themselves to these general expressions and disregarding the specifications which ascertain and limit their import they had exercised an unlimited power of providing for the common defense and general welfare i appeal to the objectors themselves whether they would in that case have employed the same reasoning in justification of congress as they now make use of against the convention how difficult it is for error to escape its own condemnation the second class of powers lodged in the general government consists of those which regulate the intercourse with foreign nations to wit to make treaties to send and receive ambassadors other public ministers and consuls to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations to regulate foreign commerce including a power to prohibit after the year 1808 the importation of slaves and to lay an intermediate duty of ten dollars per head as a discouragement to such importations this class of powers forms an obvious and essential branch of the federal administration if we are to be one nation in any respect it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations the powers to make treaties and to send and receive ambassadors speak their own propriety both of them are comprised in the articles of confederation with this difference only that the former is disembarrassed by the plan of the convention of an exception under which treaties might be substantially frustrated by regulations of the states and that a power of appointing and receiving other public ministers and consuls is expressly and very properly added to the former provision concerning ambassadors the term ambassador if taken strictly as seems to be required by the second of the articles of confederation comprehends the highest grade only of public ministers and excludes the grades which the united states will be most likely to prefer where foreign embassies may be necessary and under no latitude of construction will the term comprehend consuls yet it has been found expedient and has been the practice of congress to employ the inferior grades of public ministers and to send and receive consuls it is true that where treaties of commerce stipulate for the mutual appointment of consuls whose functions are connected with commerce the admission of foreign consuls may fall within the power of making commercial treaties and that where no such treaties exist the mission of american consuls into foreign countries may perhaps be covered under the authority given by the ninth article of the confederation to appoint all such civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the united states but the admission of consuls into the united states where no previous treaty has stipulated it seems to have been nowhere provided for a supply of the omission is one of the lesser instances in which the convention have improved on the model before them but the most minute provisions become important when they tend to obviate the necessity or the pretext for gradual and unobserved usurpations of power a list of the cases in which congress have been betrayed or forced by the defects of the confederation into violations of their chartered authorities would not a little surprise those who have paid no attention to the subject and would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of the new constitution which seems to have provided no less studiously for the lesser than the more obvious and striking defects of the old the power to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and offenses against the law of nations belongs with equal propriety to the general government and is a still greater improvement on the articles of confederation these articles contain no provision for the case of offenses against the law of nations and consequently leave it in the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the confederacy with foreign nations the provision of the federal articles on the subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to the establishment of courts for the trial of these offenses the definition of piracies might perhaps without inconveniency be left to the law of nations though a legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes a definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently requisite felony is a term of loose signification even in the common law of england and of various import in the statute law of that kingdom but neither the common nor the statute law of that or of any other nation ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this unless previously made its own by legislative adoption the meaning of the term as defined in the codes of the several states would be as impracticable as the former would be a dishonorable and illegitimate guide it is not precisely the same in any two of the states and varies in each with every revision of its criminal laws for the sake of certainty and uniformity therefore the power of defining felonies in this case was in every respect necessary and proper the regulation of foreign commerce having fallen within several views which have been taken of this subject has been too fully discussed to need additional proofs here of its being properly submitted to the federal administration it were doubtless to be wished that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the year 1808 or rather that it had been suffered to have immediate operation but it is not difficult to account either for this restriction on the general government or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed it ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity that a period of twenty years may terminate forever within these states a traffic which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern policy that within that period it will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government and may be totally abolished by a concurrence of the few states which continue the unnatural traffic in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great a majority of the union happy would it be for the unfortunate africans if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their european brethren attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection against the constitution by representing it on one side as a criminal toleration of an illicit practice and on another as calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from europe to america i mention these misconstructions not with a view to give them an answer for they deserve none but as specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit to conduct their opposition to the proposed government the powers included in the third class are those which provide for the harmony and proper intercourse among the states under this head might be included the particular restraints imposed on the authority of the states and certain powers of the judicial department but the former are reserved for a distinct class and the latter will be particularly examined when we arrive at the structure and organization of the government i shall confine myself to a cursory review of the remaining powers comprehended under this third description to wit to regulate commerce among the several states and the indian tribes to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin to provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the current coin and securities of the united states to fix the standard of weights and measures to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and uniform laws of bankruptcy to prescribe the manner in which the public acts records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved and the effect they shall have in other states and to establish post offices and post roads the defect of power in the existing confederacy to regulate the commerce between its several members is in the number of those which have been clearly pointed out by experience to the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into view on this subject it may be added that without this supplemental provision the great and essential power of regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and ineffectual a very material object of this power was the relief of the states which import and export through other states from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter were these at liberty to regulate the trade between state and state it must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles of import and export during the passage through their jurisdiction with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and the consumers of the former we may be assured by past experience that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs that it would nourish unceasing animosities and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquillity to those who do not view the question through the medium of passion or of interest the desire of the commercial states to collect in any form an indirect revenue from their uncommercial neighbors must appear not less impolitic than it is unfair since it would stimulate the injured party by resentment as well as interest to resort to less convenient channels for their foreign trade but the mild voice of reason pleading the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest is but too often drowned before public bodies as well as individuals by the clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain the necessity of a superintending authority over the reciprocal trade of confederated states has been illustrated by other examples as well as our own in switzerland where the union is so very slight each canton is obliged to allow to merchandises a passage through its jurisdiction into other cantons without an augmentation of the tolls in germany it is a law of the empire that the princes and states shall not lay tolls or customs on bridges rivers or passages without the consent of the emperor and the diet though it appears from a quotation in an antecedent paper that the practice in this as in many other instances in that confederacy has not followed the law and has produced there the mischiefs which have been foreseen here among the restraints imposed by the union of the netherlands on its members one is that they shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their neighbors without the general permission the regulation of commerce with the indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of confederation which render the provision obscure and contradictory the power is there restrained to indians not members of any of the states and is not to violate or infringe the legislative right of any state within its own limits what description of indians are to be deemed members of a state is not yet settled and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with indians though not members of a state yet residing within its legislative jurisdiction can be regulated by an external authority without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation is absolutely incomprehensible this is not the only case in which the articles of confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to accomplish impossibilities to reconcile a partial sovereignty in the union with complete sovereignty in the states to subvert a mathematical axiom by taking away a part and letting the whole remain all that need be remarked on the power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin is that by providing for this last case the constitution has supplied a material omission in the articles of confederation the authority of the existing congress is restrained to the regulation of coin struck by their own authority or that of the respective states it must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity in the value of the current coin might be destroyed by subjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of the different states the punishment of counterfeiting the public securities as well as the current coin is submitted of course to that authority which is to secure the value of both the regulation of weights and measures is transferred from the articles of confederation and is founded on like considerations with the preceding power of regulating coin the dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has long been remarked as a fault in our system and as laying a foundation for intricate and delicate questions in the fourth article of the confederation it is declared that the free inhabitants of each of these states paupers vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states and the people of each state shall in every other enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce etc there is a confusion of language here which is remarkable why the terms free inhabitants are used in one part of the article free citizens in another and people in another or what was meant by superadding to all privileges and immunities of free citizens all the privileges of trade and commerce cannot easily be determined it seems to be a construction scarcely avoidable however that those who come under the denomination of free inhabitants of a state although not citizens of such state are entitled in every other state to all the privileges of free citizens of the latter that is to greater privileges than they may be entitled to in their own state so that it may be in the power of a particular state or rather every state is laid under a necessity not only to confer the rights of citizenship in other states upon any whom it may admit to such rights within itself but upon any whom it may allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction but were an exposition of the term inhabitants to be admitted which would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens alone the difficulty is diminished only not removed the very improper power would still be retained by each state of naturalizing aliens in every other state in one state residence for a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship in another qualifications of greater importance are required an alien therefore legally incapacitated for certain rights in the latter may by previous residence only in the former elude his incapacity and thus the law of one state be preposterously rendered paramount to the law of another within the jurisdiction of the other we owe it to mere casualty that very serious embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped by the laws of several states certain descriptions of aliens who had rendered themselves obnoxious were laid under interdicts inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the privilege of residence what would have been the consequence if such persons by residence or otherwise had acquired the character of citizens under the laws of another state and then asserted their rights as such both to residence and citizenship within the state proscribing them whatever the legal consequences might have been other consequences would probably have resulted of too serious a nature not to be provided against the new constitution has accordingly with great propriety made provision against them and all others proceeding from the defect of the confederation on this head by authorizing the general government to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the united states the power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie or be removed into different states that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question the power of prescribing by general laws the manner in which the public acts records and judicial proceedings of each state shall be proved and the effect they shall have in other states is an evident and valuable improvement on the clause relating to this subject in the articles of confederation the meaning of the latter is extremely indeterminate and can be of little importance under any interpretation which it will bear the power here established may be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice and be particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous states where the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly translated in any stage of the process within a foreign jurisdiction the power of establishing post roads must in every view be a harmless power and may perhaps by judicious management become productive of great public conveniency nothing which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the states can be deemed unworthy of the public care the fourth class comprises the following miscellaneous powers 1 a power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for a limited time to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries the utility of this power will scarcely be questioned the copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged in great britain to be a right of common law the right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors the public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of individuals the states cannot separately make effectual provisions for either of the cases and most of them have anticipated the decision of this point by laws passed at the instance of congress 2 to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district not exceeding ten miles square as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislatures of the states in which the same shall be for the erection of forts magazines arsenals dockyards and other needful buildings the indispensable necessity of complete authority at the seat of government carries its own evidence with it it is a power exercised by every legislature of the union i might say of the world by virtue of its general supremacy without it not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity but a dependence of the members of the general government on the state comprehending the seat of the government for protection in the exercise of their duty might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the confederacy this consideration has the more weight as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single state and would create so many obstacles to a removal of the government as still further to abridge its necessary independence the extent of this federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every jealousy of an opposite nature and as it is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the state ceding it as the state will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession as they will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them as a municipal legislature for local purposes derived from their own suffrages will of course be allowed them and as the authority of the legislature of the state and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it to concur in the cession will be derived from the whole people of the state in their adoption of the constitution every imaginable objection seems to be obviated the necessity of a like authority over forts magazines etc established by the general government is not less evident the public money expended on such places and the public property deposited in them requires that they should be exempt from the authority of the particular state nor would it be proper for the places on which the security of the entire union may depend to be in any degree dependent on a particular member of it all objections and scruples are here also obviated by requiring the concurrence of the states concerned in every such establishment 3 to declare the punishment of treason but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture except during the life of the person attained as treason may be committed against the united states the authority of the united states ought to be enabled to punish it but as newfangled and artificial treasons have been the great engines by which violent factions the natural offspring of free government have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each other the convention have with great judgment opposed a barrier to this peculiar danger by inserting a constitutional definition of the crime fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it and restraining the congress even in punishing it from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author 4 to admit new states into the union but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states or parts of states without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the congress in the articles of confederation no provision is found on this important subject canada was to be admitted of right on her joining in the measures of the united states and the other colonies by which were evidently meant the other british colonies at the discretion of nine states the eventual establishment of new states seems to have been overlooked by the compilers of that instrument we have seen the inconvenience of this omission and the assumption of power into which congress have been led by it with great propriety therefore has the new system supplied the defect the general precaution that no new states shall be formed without the concurrence of the federal authority and that of the states concerned is consonant to the principles which ought to govern such transactions the particular precaution against the erection of new states by the partition of a state without its consent quiets the jealousy of the larger states as that of the smaller is quieted by a like precaution against a junction of states without their consent 5 to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the united states with a proviso that nothing in the constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the united states or of any particular state this is a power of very great importance and required by considerations similar to those which show the propriety of the former the proviso annexed is proper in itself and was probably rendered absolutely necessary by jealousies and questions concerning the western territory sufficiently known to the public 6 to guarantee to every state in the union a republican form of government to protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against domestic violence in a confederacy founded on republican principles and composed of republican members the superintending government ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against aristocratic or monarchial innovations the more intimate the nature of such a union may be the greater interest have the members in the political institutions of each other and the greater right to insist that the forms of government under which the compact was entered into should be substantially maintained but a right implies a remedy and where else could the remedy be deposited than where it is deposited by the constitution governments of dissimilar principles and forms have been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort than those of a kindred nature as the confederate republic of germany says montesquieu consists of free cities and petty states subject to different princes experience shows us that it is more imperfect than that of holland and switzerland greece was undone he adds as soon as the king of macedon obtained a seat among the amphictyons in the latter case no doubt the disproportionate force as well as the monarchical form of the new confederate had its share of influence on the events it may possibly be asked what need there could be of such a precaution and whether it may not become a pretext for alterations in the state governments without the concurrence of the states themselves these questions admit of ready answers if the interposition of the general government should not be needed the provision for such an event will be a harmless superfluity only in the constitution but who can say what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular states by the ambition of enterprising leaders or by the intrigues and influence of foreign powers to the second question it may be answered that if the general government should interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority it will be of course bound to pursue the authority but the authority extends no further than to a guaranty of a republican form of government which supposes a preexisting government of the form which is to be guaranteed as long therefore as the existing republican forms are continued by the states they are guaranteed by the federal constitution whenever the states may choose to substitute other republican forms they have a right to do so and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter the only restriction imposed on them is that they shall not exchange republican for antirepublican constitutions a restriction which it is presumed will hardly be considered as a grievance a protection against invasion is due from every society to the parts composing it the latitude of the expression here used seems to secure each state not only against foreign hostility but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its more powerful neighbors the history both of ancient and modern confederacies proves that the weaker members of the union ought not to be insensible to the policy of this article protection against domestic violence is added with equal propriety it has been remarked that even among the swiss cantons which properly speaking are not under one government provision is made for this object and the history of that league informs us that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded and as well by the most democratic as the other cantons a recent and wellknown event among ourselves has warned us to be prepared for emergencies of a like nature at first view it might seem not to square with the republican theory to suppose either that a majority have not the right or that a minority will have the force to subvert a government and consequently that the federal interposition can never be required but when it would be improper but theoretic reasoning in this as in most other cases must be qualified by the lessons of practice why may not illicit combinations for purposes of violence be formed as well by a majority of a state especially a small state as by a majority of a county or a district of the same state and if the authority of the state ought in the latter case to protect the local magistracy ought not the federal authority in the former to support the state authority besides there are certain parts of the state constitutions which are so interwoven with the federal constitution that a violent blow cannot be given to the one without communicating the wound to the other insurrections in a state will rarely induce a federal interposition unless the number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of government it will be much better that the violence in such cases should be repressed by the superintending power than that the majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and obstinate contest the existence of a right to interpose will generally prevent the necessity of exerting it is it true that force and right are necessarily on the same side in republican governments may not the minor party possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources of military talents and experience or of secret succors from foreign powers as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword may not a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the same side against a superior number so situated as to be less capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of actual force victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail in a census of the inhabitants or which determine the event of an election may it not happen in fine that the minority of citizens may become a majority of persons by the accession of alien residents of a casual concourse of adventurers or of those whom the constitution of the state has not admitted to the rights of suffrage i take no notice of an unhappy species of population abounding in some of the states who during the calm of regular government are sunk below the level of men but who in the tempestuous scenes of civil violence may emerge into the human character and give a superiority of strength to any party with which they may associate themselves in cases where it may be doubtful on which side justice lies what better umpires could be desired by two violent factions flying to arms and tearing a state to pieces than the representatives of confederate states not heated by the local flame to the impartiality of judges they would unite the affection of friends happy would it be if such a remedy for its infirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments if a project equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of mankind should it be asked what is to be the redress for an insurrection pervading all the states and comprising a superiority of the entire force though not a constitutional right the answer must be that such a case as it would be without the compass of human remedies so it is fortunately not within the compass of human probability and that it is a sufficient recommendation of the federal constitution that it diminishes the risk of a calamity for which no possible constitution can provide a cure among the advantages of a confederate republic enumerated by montesquieu an important one is that should a popular insurrection happen in one of the states the others are able to quell it should abuses creep into one part they are reformed by those that remain sound 7 to consider all debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption of this constitution as being no less valid against the united states under this constitution than under the confederation this can only be considered as a declaratory proposition and may have been inserted among other reasons for the satisfaction of the foreign creditors of the united states who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine that a change in the political form of civil society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral obligations among the lesser criticisms which have been exercised on the constitution it has been remarked that the validity of engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of the united states as well as against them and in the spirit which usually characterizes little critics the omission has been transformed and magnified into a plot against the national rights the authors of this discovery may be told what few others need to be informed of that as engagements are in their nature reciprocal an assertion of their validity on one side necessarily involves a validity on the other side and that as the article is merely declaratory the establishment of the principle in one case is sufficient for every case they may be further told that every constitution must limit its precautions to dangers that are not altogether imaginary and that no real danger can exist that the government would dare with or even without this constitutional declaration before it to remit the debts justly due to the public on the pretext here condemned 8 to provide for amendments to be ratified by three fourths of the states under two exceptions only that useful alterations will be suggested by experience could not but be foreseen it was requisite therefore that a mode for introducing them should be provided the mode preferred by the convention seems to be stamped with every mark of propriety it guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the constitution too mutable and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults it moreover equally enables the general and the state governments to originate the amendment of errors as they may be pointed out by the experience on one side or on the other the exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the senate was probably meant as a palladium to the residuary sovereignty of the states implied and secured by that principle of representation in one branch of the legislature and was probably insisted on by the states particularly attached to that equality the other exception must have been admitted on the same considerations which produced the privilege defended by it 9 the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states ratifying the same this article speaks for itself the express authority of the people alone could give due validity to the constitution to have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen states would have subjected the essential interests of the whole to the caprice or corruption of a single member it would have marked a want of foresight in the convention which our own experience would have rendered inexcusable two questions of a very delicate nature present themselves on this occasion 1 on what principle the confederation which stands in the solemn form of a compact among the states can be superseded without the unanimous consent of the parties to it 2 what relation is to subsist between the nine or more states ratifying the constitution and the remaining few who do not become parties to it the first question is answered at once by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case to the great principle of selfpreservation to the transcendent law of nature and of natures god which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed perhaps also an answer may be found without searching beyond the principles of the compact itself it has been heretofore noted among the defects of the confederation that in many of the states it had received no higher sanction than a mere legislative ratification the principle of reciprocality seems to require that its obligation on the other states should be reduced to the same standard a compact between independent sovereigns founded on ordinary acts of legislative authority can pretend to no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties it is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other that a breach of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty and that a breach committed by either of the parties absolves the others and authorizes them if they please to pronounce the compact violated and void should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular states to a dissolution of the federal pact will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be confronted the time has been when it was incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph exhibits the scene is now changed and with it the part which the same motives dictate the second question is not less delicate and the flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an overcurious discussion of it it is one of those cases which must be left to provide for itself in general it may be observed that although no political relation can subsist between the assenting and dissenting states yet the moral relations will remain uncancelled the claims of justice both on one side and on the other will be in force and must be fulfilled the rights of humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected whilst considerations of a common interest and above all the remembrance of the endearing scenes which are past and the anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to reunion will it is hoped not urge in vain moderation on one side and prudence on the other a fifth class of provisions in favor of the federal authority consists of the following restrictions on the authority of the several states 1 no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal coin money emit bills of credit make any thing but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts pass any bill of attainder ex post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contracts or grant any title of nobility the prohibition against treaties alliances and confederations makes a part of the existing articles of union and for reasons which need no explanation is copied into the new constitution the prohibition of letters of marque is another part of the old system but is somewhat extended in the new according to the former letters of marque could be granted by the states after a declaration of war according to the latter these licenses must be obtained as well during war as previous to its declaration from the government of the united states this alteration is fully justified by the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers and of immediate responsibility to the nation in all those for whose conduct the nation itself is to be responsible the right of coining money which is here taken from the states was left in their hands by the confederation as a concurrent right with that of congress under an exception in favor of the exclusive right of congress to regulate the alloy and value in this instance also the new provision is an improvement on the old whilst the alloy and value depended on the general authority a right of coinage in the particular states could have no other effect than to multiply expensive mints and diversify the forms and weights of the circulating pieces the latter inconveniency defeats one purpose for which the power was originally submitted to the federal head and as far as the former might prevent an inconvenient remittance of gold and silver to the central mint for recoinage the end can be as well attained by local mints established under the general authority the extension of the prohibition to bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity the loss which america has sustained since the peace from the pestilent effects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man on the necessary confidence in the public councils on the industry and morals of the people and on the character of republican government constitutes an enormous debt against the states chargeable with this unadvised measure which must long remain unsatisfied or rather an accumulation of guilt which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice of the power which has been the instrument of it in addition to these persuasive considerations it may be observed that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the states the power of regulating coin prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin had every state a right to regulate the value of its coin there might be as many different currencies as states and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded retrospective alterations in its value might be made and thus the citizens of other states be injured and animosities be kindled among the states themselves the subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause and hence the union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member no one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the states to emit paper money than to coin gold or silver the power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts is withdrawn from the states on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency bills of attainder ex post facto laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first principles of the social compact and to every principle of sound legislation the two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters our own experience has taught us nevertheless that additional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted very properly therefore have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights and i am much deceived if they have not in so doing as faithfully consulted the genuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their constituents the sober people of america are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils they have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences in cases affecting personal rights become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators and snares to the moreindustrious and lessinformed part of the community they have seen too that one legislative interference is but the first link of a long chain of repetitions every subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of the preceding they very rightly infer therefore that some thorough reform is wanting which will banish speculations on public measures inspire a general prudence and industry and give a regular course to the business of society the prohibition with respect to titles of nobility is copied from the articles of confederation and needs no comment 2 no state shall without the consent of the congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any state on imports or exports shall be for the use of the treasury of the united states and all such laws shall be subject to the revision and control of the congress no state shall without the consent of congress lay any duty on tonnage keep troops or ships of war in time of peace enter into any agreement or compact with another state or with a foreign power or engage in war unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay the restraint on the power of the states over imports and exports is enforced by all the arguments which prove the necessity of submitting the regulation of trade to the federal councils it is needless therefore to remark further on this head than that the manner in which the restraint is qualified seems well calculated at once to secure to the states a reasonable discretion in providing for the conveniency of their imports and exports and to the united states a reasonable check against the abuse of this discretion the remaining particulars of this clause fall within reasonings which are either so obvious or have been so fully developed that they may be passed over without remark the sixth and last class consists of the several powers and provisions by which efficacy is given to all the rest 1 of these the first is the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof few parts of the constitution have been assailed with more intemperance than this yet on a fair investigation of it no part can appear more completely invulnerable without the substance of this power the whole constitution would be a dead letter those who object to the article therefore as a part of the constitution can only mean that the form of the provision is improper but have they considered whether a better form could have been substituted there are four other possible methods which the constitution might have taken on this subject they might have copied the second article of the existing confederation which would have prohibited the exercise of any power not expressly delegated they might have attempted a positive enumeration of the powers comprehended under the general terms necessary and proper they might have attempted a negative enumeration of them by specifying the powers excepted from the general definition they might have been altogether silent on the subject leaving these necessary and proper powers to construction and inference had the convention taken the first method of adopting the second article of confederation it is evident that the new congress would be continually exposed as their predecessors have been to the alternative of construing the term expressly with so much rigor as to disarm the government of all real authority whatever or with so much latitude as to destroy altogether the force of the restriction it would be easy to show if it were necessary that no important power delegated by the articles of confederation has been or can be executed by congress without recurring more or less to the doctrine of construction or implication as the powers delegated under the new system are more extensive the government which is to administer it would find itself still more distressed with the alternative of betraying the public interests by doing nothing or of violating the constitution by exercising powers indispensably necessary and proper but at the same time not expressly granted had the convention attempted a positive enumeration of the powers necessary and proper for carrying their other powers into effect the attempt would have involved a complete digest of laws on every subject to which the constitution relates accommodated too not only to the existing state of things but to all the possible changes which futurity may produce for in every new application of a general power the particular powers which are the means of attaining the object of the general power must always necessarily vary with that object and be often properly varied whilst the object remains the same had they attempted to enumerate the particular powers or means not necessary or proper for carrying the general powers into execution the task would have been no less chimerical and would have been liable to this further objection that every defect in the enumeration would have been equivalent to a positive grant of authority if to avoid this consequence they had attempted a partial enumeration of the exceptions and described the residue by the general terms not necessary or proper it must have happened that the enumeration would comprehend a few of the excepted powers only that these would be such as would be least likely to be assumed or tolerated because the enumeration would of course select such as would be least necessary or proper and that the unnecessary and improper powers included in the residuum would be less forcibly excepted than if no partial enumeration had been made had the constitution been silent on this head there can be no doubt that all the particular powers requisite as means of executing the general powers would have resulted to the government by unavoidable implication no axiom is more clearly established in law or in reason than that wherever the end is required the means are authorized wherever a general power to do a thing is given every particular power necessary for doing it is included had this last method therefore been pursued by the convention every objection now urged against their plan would remain in all its plausibility and the real inconveniency would be incurred of not removing a pretext which may be seized on critical occasions for drawing into question the essential powers of the union if it be asked what is to be the consequence in case the congress shall misconstrue this part of the constitution and exercise powers not warranted by its true meaning i answer the same as if they should misconstrue or enlarge any other power vested in them as if the general power had been reduced to particulars and any one of these were to be violated the same in short as if the state legislatures should violate the irrespective constitutional authorities in the first instance the success of the usurpation will depend on the executive and judiciary departments which are to expound and give effect to the legislative acts and in the last resort a remedy must be obtained from the people who can by the election of more faithful representatives annul the acts of the usurpers the truth is that this ultimate redress may be more confided in against unconstitutional acts of the federal than of the state legislatures for this plain reason that as every such act of the former will be an invasion of the rights of the latter these will be ever ready to mark the innovation to sound the alarm to the people and to exert their local influence in effecting a change of federal representatives there being no such intermediate body between the state legislatures and the people interested in watching the conduct of the former violations of the state constitutions are more likely to remain unnoticed and unredressed 2 this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding the indiscreet zeal of the adversaries to the constitution has betrayed them into an attack on this part of it also without which it would have been evidently and radically defective to be fully sensible of this we need only suppose for a moment that the supremacy of the state constitutions had been left complete by a saving clause in their favor in the first place as these constitutions invest the state legislatures with absolute sovereignty in all cases not excepted by the existing articles of confederation all the authorities contained in the proposed constitution so far as they exceed those enumerated in the confederation would have been annulled and the new congress would have been reduced to the same impotent condition with their predecessors in the next place as the constitutions of some of the states do not even expressly and fully recognize the existing powers of the confederacy an express saving of the supremacy of the former would in such states have brought into question every power contained in the proposed constitution in the third place as the constitutions of the states differ much from each other it might happen that a treaty or national law of great and equal importance to the states would interfere with some and not with other constitutions and would consequently be valid in some of the states at the same time that it would have no effect in others in fine the world would have seen for the first time a system of government founded on an inversion of the fundamental principles of all government it would have seen the authority of the whole society every where subordinate to the authority of the parts it would have seen a monster in which the head was under the direction of the members 3 the senators and representatives and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution it has been asked why it was thought necessary that the state magistracy should be bound to support the federal constitution and unnecessary that a like oath should be imposed on the officers of the united states in favor of the state constitutions several reasons might be assigned for the distinction i content myself with one which is obvious and conclusive the members of the federal government will have no agency in carrying the state constitutions into effect the members and officers of the state governments on the contrary will have an essential agency in giving effect to the federal constitution the election of the president and senate will depend in all cases on the legislatures of the several states and the election of the house of representatives will equally depend on the same authority in the first instance and will probably forever be conducted by the officers and according to the laws of the states 4 among the provisions for giving efficacy to the federal powers might be added those which belong to the executive and judiciary departments but as these are reserved for particular examination in another place i pass them over in this we have now reviewed in detail all the articles composing the sum or quantity of power delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government and are brought to this undeniable conclusion that no part of the power is unnecessary or improper for accomplishing the necessary objects of the union the question therefore whether this amount of power shall be granted or not resolves itself into another question whether or not a government commensurate to the exigencies of the union shall be established or in other words whether the union itself shall be preserved having shown that no one of the powers transferred to the federal government is unnecessary or improper the next question to be considered is whether the whole mass of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority left in the several states the adversaries to the plan of the convention instead of considering in the first place what degree of power was absolutely necessary for the purposes of the federal government have exhausted themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree of power to the governments of the particular states but if the union as has been shown be essential to the security of the people of america against foreign danger if it be essential to their security against contentions and wars among the different states if it be essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter the blessings of liberty and against those military establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain if in a word the union be essential to the happiness of the people of america is it not preposterous to urge as an objection to a government without which the objects of the union cannot be attained that such a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual states was then the american revolution effected was the american confederacy formed was the precious blood of thousands spilt and the hardearned substance of millions lavished not that the people of america should enjoy peace liberty and safety but that the government of the individual states that particular municipal establishments might enjoy a certain extent of power and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty we have heard of the impious doctrine in the old world that the people were made for kings not kings for the people is the same doctrine to be revived in the new in another shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form it is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good the real welfare of the great body of the people is the supreme object to be pursued and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object were the plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness my voice would be reject the plan were the union itself inconsistent with the public happiness it would be abolish the union in like manner as far as the sovereignty of the states cannot be reconciled to the happiness of the people the voice of every good citizen must be let the former be sacrificed to the latter how far the sacrifice is necessary has been shown how far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered is the question before us several important considerations have been touched in the course of these papers which discountenance the supposition that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove fatal to the state governments the more i revolve the subject the more fully i am persuaded that the balance is much more likely to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first scale we have seen in all the examples of ancient and modern confederacies the strongest tendency continually betraying itself in the members to despoil the general government of its authorities with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to defend itself against the encroachments although in most of these examples the system has been so dissimilar from that under consideration as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the latter from the fate of the former yet as the states will retain under the proposed constitution a very extensive portion of active sovereignty the inference ought not to be wholly disregarded in the achaean league it is probable that the federal head had a degree and species of power which gave it a considerable likeness to the government framed by the convention the lycian confederacy as far as its principles and form are transmitted must have borne a still greater analogy to it yet history does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated or tended to degenerate into one consolidated government on the contrary we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the dissensions and finally the disunion of the subordinate authorities these cases are the more worthy of our attention as the external causes by which the component parts were pressed together were much more numerous and powerful than in our case and consequently less powerful ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members to the head and to each other in the feudal system we have seen a similar propensity exemplified notwithstanding the want of proper sympathy in every instance between the local sovereigns and the people and the sympathy in some instances between the general sovereign and the latter it usually happened that the local sovereigns prevailed in the rivalship for encroachments had no external dangers enforced internal harmony and subordination and particularly had the local sovereigns possessed the affections of the people the great kingdoms in europe would at this time consist of as many independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons the state governments will have the advantage of the federal government whether we compare them in respect to the immediate dependence of the one on the other to the weight of personal influence which each side will possess to the powers respectively vested in them to the predilection and probable support of the people to the disposition and faculty of resisting and frustrating the measures of each other the state governments may be regarded as constituent and essential parts of the federal government whilst the latter is nowise essential to the operation or organization of the former without the intervention of the state legislatures the president of the united states cannot be elected at all they must in all cases have a great share in his appointment and will perhaps in most cases of themselves determine it the senate will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the state legislatures even the house of representatives though drawn immediately from the people will be chosen very much under the influence of that class of men whose influence over the people obtains for themselves an election into the state legislatures thus each of the principal branches of the federal government will owe its existence more or less to the favor of the state governments and must consequently feel a dependence which is much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too overbearing towards them on the other side the component parts of the state governments will in no instance be indebted for their appointment to the direct agency of the federal government and very little if at all to the local influence of its members the number of individuals employed under the constitution of the united states will be much smaller than the number employed under the particular states there will consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the former than of the latter the members of the legislative executive and judiciary departments of thirteen and more states the justices of peace officers of militia ministerial officers of justice with all the county corporation and town officers for three millions and more of people intermixed and having particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people must exceed beyond all proportion both in number and influence those of every description who will be employed in the administration of the federal system compare the members of the three great departments of the thirteen states excluding from the judiciary department the justices of peace with the members of the corresponding departments of the single government of the union compare the militia officers of three millions of people with the military and marine officers of any establishment which is within the compass of probability or i may add of possibility and in this view alone we may pronounce the advantage of the states to be decisive if the federal government is to have collectors of revenue the state governments will have theirs also and as those of the former will be principally on the seacoast and not very numerous whilst those of the latter will be spread over the face of the country and will be very numerous the advantage in this view also lies on the same side it is true that the confederacy is to possess and may exercise the power of collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the states but it is probable that this power will not be resorted to except for supplemental purposes of revenue that an option will then be given to the states to supply their quotas by previous collections of their own and that the eventual collection under the immediate authority of the union will generally be made by the officers and according to the rules appointed by the several states indeed it is extremely probable that in other instances particularly in the organization of the judicial power the officers of the states will be clothed with the correspondent authority of the union should it happen however that separate collectors of internal revenue should be appointed under the federal government the influence of the whole number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of state officers in the opposite scale within every district to which a federal collector would be allotted there would not be less than thirty or forty or even more officers of different descriptions and many of them persons of character and weight whose influence would lie on the side of the state the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce with which last the power of taxation will for the most part be connected the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people and the internal order improvement and prosperity of the state the operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger those of the state governments in times of peace and security as the former periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter the state governments will here enjoy another advantage over the federal government the more adequate indeed the federal powers may be rendered to the national defense the less frequent will be those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the governments of the particular states if the new constitution be examined with accuracy and candor it will be found that the change which it proposes consists much less in the addition of new powers to the union than in the invigoration of its original powers the regulation of commerce it is true is a new power but that seems to be an addition which few oppose and from which no apprehensions are entertained the powers relating to war and peace armies and fleets treaties and finance with the other more considerable powers are all vested in the existing congress by the articles of confederation the proposed change does not enlarge these powers it only substitutes a more effectual mode of administering them the change relating to taxation may be regarded as the most important and yet the present congress have as complete authority to require of the states indefinite supplies of money for the common defense and general welfare as the future congress will have to require them of individual citizens and the latter will be no more bound than the states themselves have been to pay the quotas respectively taxed on them had the states complied punctually with the articles of confederation or could their compliance have been enforced by as peaceable means as may be used with success towards single persons our past experience is very far from countenancing an opinion that the state governments would have lost their constitutional powers and have gradually undergone an entire consolidation to maintain that such an event would have ensued would be to say at once that the existence of the state governments is incompatible with any system whatever that accomplishes the essential purposes of the union resuming the subject of the last paper i proceed to inquire whether the federal government or the state governments will have the advantage with regard to the predilection and support of the people notwithstanding the different modes in which they are appointed we must consider both of them as substantially dependent on the great body of the citizens of the united states i assume this position here as it respects the first reserving the proofs for another place the federal and state governments are in fact but different agents and trustees of the people constituted with different powers and designed for different purposes the adversaries of the constitution seem to have lost sight of the people altogether in their reasonings on this subject and to have viewed these different establishments not only as mutual rivals and enemies but as uncontrolled by any common superior in their efforts to usurp the authorities of each other these gentlemen must here be reminded of their error they must be told that the ultimate authority wherever the derivative may be found resides in the people alone and that it will not depend merely on the comparative ambition or address of the different governments whether either or which of them will be able to enlarge its sphere of jurisdiction at the expense of the other truth no less than decency requires that the event in every case should be supposed to depend on the sentiments and sanction of their common constituents many considerations besides those suggested on a former occasion seem to place it beyond doubt that the first and most natural attachment of the people will be to the governments of their respective states into the administration of these a greater number of individuals will expect to rise from the gift of these a greater number of offices and emoluments will flow by the superintending care of these all the more domestic and personal interests of the people will be regulated and provided for with the affairs of these the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant and with the members of these will a greater proportion of the people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship and of family and party attachments on the side of these therefore the popular bias may well be expected most strongly to incline experience speaks the same language in this case the federal administration though hitherto very defective in comparison with what may be hoped under a better system had during the war and particularly whilst the independent fund of paper emissions was in credit an activity and importance as great as it can well have in any future circumstances whatever it was engaged too in a course of measures which had for their object the protection of everything that was dear and the acquisition of everything that could be desirable to the people at large it was nevertheless invariably found after the transient enthusiasm for the early congresses was over that the attention and attachment of the people were turned anew to their own particular governments that the federal council was at no time the idol of popular favor and that opposition to proposed enlargements of its powers and importance was the side usually taken by the men who wished to build their political consequence on the prepossessions of their fellowcitizens if therefore as has been elsewhere remarked the people should in future become more partial to the federal than to the state governments the change can only result from such manifest and irresistible proofs of a better administration as will overcome all their antecedent propensities and in that case the people ought not surely to be precluded from giving most of their confidence where they may discover it to be most due but even in that case the state governments could have little to apprehend because it is only within a certain sphere that the federal power can in the nature of things be advantageously administered the remaining points on which i propose to compare the federal and state governments are the disposition and the faculty they may respectively possess to resist and frustrate the measures of each other it has been already proved that the members of the federal will be more dependent on the members of the state governments than the latter will be on the former it has appeared also that the prepossessions of the people on whom both will depend will be more on the side of the state governments than of the federal government so far as the disposition of each towards the other may be influenced by these causes the state governments must clearly have the advantage but in a distinct and very important point of view the advantage will lie on the same side the prepossessions which the members themselves will carry into the federal government will generally be favorable to the states whilst it will rarely happen that the members of the state governments will carry into the public councils a bias in favor of the general government a local spirit will infallibly prevail much more in the members of congress than a national spirit will prevail in the legislatures of the particular states every one knows that a great proportion of the errors committed by the state legislatures proceeds from the disposition of the members to sacrifice the comprehensive and permanent interest of the state to the particular and separate views of the counties or districts in which they reside and if they do not sufficiently enlarge their policy to embrace the collective welfare of their particular state how can it be imagined that they will make the aggregate prosperity of the union and the dignity and respectability of its government the objects of their affections and consultations for the same reason that the members of the state legislatures will be unlikely to attach themselves sufficiently to national objects the members of the federal legislature will be likely to attach themselves too much to local objects the states will be to the latter what counties and towns are to the former measures will too often be decided according to their probable effect not on the national prosperity and happiness but on the prejudices interests and pursuits of the governments and people of the individual states what is the spirit that has in general characterized the proceedings of congress a perusal of their journals as well as the candid acknowledgments of such as have had a seat in that assembly will inform us that the members have but too frequently displayed the character rather of partisans of their respective states than of impartial guardians of a common interest that where on one occasion improper sacrifices have been made of local considerations to the aggrandizement of the federal government the great interests of the nation have suffered on a hundred from an undue attention to the local prejudices interests and views of the particular states i mean not by these reflections to insinuate that the new federal government will not embrace a more enlarged plan of policy than the existing government may have pursued much less that its views will be as confined as those of the state legislatures but only that it will partake sufficiently of the spirit of both to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual states or the prerogatives of their governments the motives on the part of the state governments to augment their prerogatives by defalcations from the federal government will be overruled by no reciprocal predispositions in the members were it admitted however that the federal government may feel an equal disposition with the state governments to extend its power beyond the due limits the latter would still have the advantage in the means of defeating such encroachments if an act of a particular state though unfriendly to the national government be generally popular in that state and should not too grossly violate the oaths of the state officers it is executed immediately and of course by means on the spot and depending on the state alone the opposition of the federal government or the interposition of federal officers would but inflame the zeal of all parties on the side of the state and the evil could not be prevented or repaired if at all without the employment of means which must always be resorted to with reluctance and difficulty on the other hand should an unwarrantable measure of the federal government be unpopular in particular states which would seldom fail to be the case or even a warrantable measure be so which may sometimes be the case the means of opposition to it are powerful and at hand the disquietude of the people their repugnance and perhaps refusal to cooperate with the officers of the union the frowns of the executive magistracy of the state the embarrassments created by legislative devices which would often be added on such occasions would oppose in any state difficulties not to be despised would form in a large state very serious impediments and where the sentiments of several adjoining states happened to be in unison would present obstructions which the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter but ambitious encroachments of the federal government on the authority of the state governments would not excite the opposition of a single state or of a few states only they would be signals of general alarm every government would espouse the common cause a correspondence would be opened plans of resistance would be concerted one spirit would animate and conduct the whole the same combinations in short would result from an apprehension of the federal as was produced by the dread of a foreign yoke and unless the projected innovations should be voluntarily renounced the same appeal to a trial of force would be made in the one case as was made in the other but what degree of madness could ever drive the federal government to such an extremity in the contest with great britain one part of the empire was employed against the other the more numerous part invaded the rights of the less numerous part the attempt was unjust and unwise but it was not in speculation absolutely chimerical but what would be the contest in the case we are supposing who would be the parties a few representatives of the people would be opposed to the people themselves or rather one set of representatives would be contending against thirteen sets of representatives with the whole body of their common constituents on the side of the latter the only refuge left for those who prophesy the downfall of the state governments is the visionary supposition that the federal government may previously accumulate a military force for the projects of ambition the reasonings contained in these papers must have been employed to little purpose indeed if it could be necessary now to disprove the reality of this danger that the people and the states should for a sufficient period of time elect an uninterrupted succession of men ready to betray both that the traitors should throughout this period uniformly and systematically pursue some fixed plan for the extension of the military establishment that the governments and the people of the states should silently and patiently behold the gathering storm and continue to supply the materials until it should be prepared to burst on their own heads must appear to every one more like the incoherent dreams of a delirious jealousy or the misjudged exaggerations of a counterfeit zeal than like the sober apprehensions of genuine patriotism extravagant as the supposition is let it however be made let a regular army fully equal to the resources of the country be formed and let it be entirely at the devotion of the federal government still it would not be going too far to say that the state governments with the people on their side would be able to repel the danger the highest number to which according to the best computation a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the whole number of souls or one twentyfifth part of the number able to bear arms this proportion would not yield in the united states an army of more than twentyfive or thirty thousand men to these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands officered by men chosen from among themselves fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence it may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops those who are best acquainted with the last successful resistance of this country against the british arms will be most inclined to deny the possibility of it besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms and it is not certain that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes but were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves who could collect the national will and direct the national force and of officers appointed out of the militia by these governments and attached both to them and to the militia it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance that the throne of every tyranny in europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of america with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors let us rather no longer insult them with the supposition that they can ever reduce themselves to the necessity of making the experiment by a blind and tame submission to the long train of insidious measures which must precede and produce it the argument under the present head may be put into a very concise form which appears altogether conclusive either the mode in which the federal government is to be constructed will render it sufficiently dependent on the people or it will not on the first supposition it will be restrained by that dependence from forming schemes obnoxious to their constituents on the other supposition it will not possess the confidence of the people and its schemes of usurpation will be easily defeated by the state governments who will be supported by the people on summing up the considerations stated in this and the last paper they seem to amount to the most convincing evidence that the powers proposed to be lodged in the federal government are as little formidable to those reserved to the individual states as they are indispensably necessary to accomplish the purposes of the union and that all those alarms which have been sounded of a meditated and consequential annihilation of the state governments must on the most favorable interpretation be ascribed to the chimerical fears of the authors of them having reviewed the general form of the proposed government and the general mass of power allotted to it i proceed to examine the particular structure of this government and the distribution of this mass of power among its constituent parts one of the principal objections inculcated by the more respectable adversaries to the constitution is its supposed violation of the political maxim that the legislative executive and judiciary departments ought to be separate and distinct in the structure of the federal government no regard it is said seems to have been paid to this essential precaution in favor of liberty the several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts no political truth is certainly of greater intrinsic value or is stamped with the authority of more enlightened patrons of liberty than that on which the objection is founded the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary selfappointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny were the federal constitution therefore really chargeable with the accumulation of power or with a mixture of powers having a dangerous tendency to such an accumulation no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system i persuade myself however that it will be made apparent to every one that the charge cannot be supported and that the maxim on which it relies has been totally misconceived and misapplied in order to form correct ideas on this important subject it will be proper to investigate the sense in which the preservation of liberty requires that the three great departments of power should be separate and distinct the oracle who is always consulted and cited on this subject is the celebrated montesquieu if he be not the author of this invaluable precept in the science of politics he has the merit at least of displaying and recommending it most effectually to the attention of mankind let us endeavor in the first place to ascertain his meaning on this point the british constitution was to montesquieu what homer has been to the didactic writers on epic poetry as the latter have considered the work of the immortal bard as the perfect model from which the principles and rules of the epic art were to be drawn and by which all similar works were to be judged so this great political critic appears to have viewed the constitution of england as the standard or to use his own expression as the mirror of political liberty and to have delivered in the form of elementary truths the several characteristic principles of that particular system that we may be sure then not to mistake his meaning in this case let us recur to the source from which the maxim was drawn on the slightest view of the british constitution we must perceive that the legislative executive and judiciary departments are by no means totally separate and distinct from each other the executive magistrate forms an integral part of the legislative authority he alone has the prerogative of making treaties with foreign sovereigns which when made have under certain limitations the force of legislative acts all the members of the judiciary department are appointed by him can be removed by him on the address of the two houses of parliament and form when he pleases to consult them one of his constitutional councils one branch of the legislative department forms also a great constitutional council to the executive chief as on another hand it is the sole depositary of judicial power in cases of impeachment and is invested with the supreme appellate jurisdiction in all other cases the judges again are so far connected with the legislative department as often to attend and participate in its deliberations though not admitted to a legislative vote from these facts by which montesquieu was guided it may clearly be inferred that in saying there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body of magistrates or if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers he did not mean that these departments ought to have no partial agency in or no control over the acts of each other his meaning as his own words import and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his eye can amount to no more than this that where the whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possess the whole power of another department the fundamental principles of a free constitution are subverted this would have been the case in the constitution examined by him if the king who is the sole executive magistrate had possessed also the complete legislative power or the supreme administration of justice or if the entire legislative body had possessed the supreme judiciary or the supreme executive authority this however is not among the vices of that constitution the magistrate in whom the whole executive power resides cannot of himself make a law though he can put a negative on every law nor administer justice in person though he has the appointment of those who do administer it the judges can exercise no executive prerogative though they are shoots from the executive stock nor any legislative function though they may be advised with by the legislative councils the entire legislature can perform no judiciary act though by the joint act of two of its branches the judges may be removed from their offices and though one of its branches is possessed of the judicial power in the last resort the entire legislature again can exercise no executive prerogative though one of its branches constitutes the supreme executive magistracy and another on the impeachment of a third can try and condemn all the subordinate officers in the executive department the reasons on which montesquieu grounds his maxim are a further demonstration of his meaning when the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body says he there can be no liberty because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner again were the power of judging joined with the legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control for the judge would then be the legislator were it joined to the executive power the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor some of these reasons are more fully explained in other passages but briefly stated as they are here they sufficiently establish the meaning which we have put on this celebrated maxim of this celebrated author if we look into the constitutions of the several states we find that notwithstanding the emphatical and in some instances the unqualified terms in which this axiom has been laid down there is not a single instance in which the several departments of power have been kept absolutely separate and distinct new hampshire whose constitution was the last formed seems to have been fully aware of the impossibility and inexpediency of avoiding any mixture whatever of these departments and has qualified the doctrine by declaring that the legislative executive and judiciary powers ought to be kept as separate from and independent of each other as the nature of a free government will admit or as is consistent with that chain of connection that binds the whole fabric of the constitution in one indissoluble bond of unity and amity her constitution accordingly mixes these departments in several respects the senate which is a branch of the legislative department is also a judicial tribunal for the trial of impeachments the president who is the head of the executive department is the presiding member also of the senate and besides an equal vote in all cases has a casting vote in case of a tie the executive head is himself eventually elective every year by the legislative department and his council is every year chosen by and from the members of the same department several of the officers of state are also appointed by the legislature and the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the executive department the constitution of massachusetts has observed a sufficient though less pointed caution in expressing this fundamental article of liberty it declares that the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers or either of them the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers or either of them the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers or either of them this declaration corresponds precisely with the doctrine of montesquieu as it has been explained and is not in a single point violated by the plan of the convention it goes no farther than to prohibit any one of the entire departments from exercising the powers of another department in the very constitution to which it is prefixed a partial mixture of powers has been admitted the executive magistrate has a qualified negative on the legislative body and the senate which is a part of the legislature is a court of impeachment for members both of the executive and judiciary departments the members of the judiciary department again are appointable by the executive department and removable by the same authority on the address of the two legislative branches lastly a number of the officers of government are annually appointed by the legislative department as the appointment to offices particularly executive offices is in its nature an executive function the compilers of the constitution have in this last point at least violated the rule established by themselves i pass over the constitutions of rhode island and connecticut because they were formed prior to the revolution and even before the principle under examination had become an object of political attention the constitution of new york contains no declaration on this subject but appears very clearly to have been framed with an eye to the danger of improperly blending the different departments it gives nevertheless to the executive magistrate a partial control over the legislative department and what is more gives a like control to the judiciary department and even blends the executive and judiciary departments in the exercise of this control in its council of appointment members of the legislative are associated with the executive authority in the appointment of officers both executive and judiciary and its court for the trial of impeachments and correction of errors is to consist of one branch of the legislature and the principal members of the judiciary department the constitution of new jersey has blended the different powers of government more than any of the preceding the governor who is the executive magistrate is appointed by the legislature is chancellor and ordinary or surrogate of the state is a member of the supreme court of appeals and president with a casting vote of one of the legislative branches the same legislative branch acts again as executive council of the governor and with him constitutes the court of appeals the members of the judiciary department are appointed by the legislative department and removable by one branch of it on the impeachment of the other according to the constitution of pennsylvania the president who is the head of the executive department is annually elected by a vote in which the legislative department predominates in conjunction with an executive council he appoints the members of the judiciary department and forms a court of impeachment for trial of all officers judiciary as well as executive the judges of the supreme court and justices of the peace seem also to be removable by the legislature and the executive power of pardoning in certain cases to be referred to the same department the members of the executive council are made exofficio justices of peace throughout the state in delaware the chief executive magistrate is annually elected by the legislative department the speakers of the two legislative branches are vicepresidents in the executive department the executive chief with six others appointed three by each of the legislative branches constitutes the supreme court of appeals he is joined with the legislative department in the appointment of the other judges throughout the states it appears that the members of the legislature may at the same time be justices of the peace in this state the members of one branch of it are exofficio justices of the peace as are also the members of the executive council the principal officers of the executive department are appointed by the legislative and one branch of the latter forms a court of impeachments all officers may be removed on address of the legislature maryland has adopted the maxim in the most unqualified terms declaring that the legislative executive and judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other her constitution notwithstanding makes the executive magistrate appointable by the legislative department and the members of the judiciary by the executive department the language of virginia is still more pointed on this subject her constitution declares that the legislative executive and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other nor shall any person exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time except that the justices of county courts shall be eligible to either house of assembly yet we find not only this express exception with respect to the members of the inferior courts but that the chief magistrate with his executive council are appointable by the legislature that two members of the latter are triennially displaced at the pleasure of the legislature and that all the principal offices both executive and judiciary are filled by the same department the executive prerogative of pardon also is in one case vested in the legislative department the constitution of north carolina which declares that the legislative executive and supreme judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other refers at the same time to the legislative department the appointment not only of the executive chief but all the principal officers within both that and the judiciary department in south carolina the constitution makes the executive magistracy eligible by the legislative department it gives to the latter also the appointment of the members of the judiciary department including even justices of the peace and sheriffs and the appointment of officers in the executive department down to captains in the army and navy of the state in the constitution of georgia where it is declared that the legislative executive and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other we find that the executive department is to be filled by appointments of the legislature and the executive prerogative of pardon to be finally exercised by the same authority even justices of the peace are to be appointed by the legislature in citing these cases in which the legislative executive and judiciary departments have not been kept totally separate and distinct i wish not to be regarded as an advocate for the particular organizations of the several state governments i am fully aware that among the many excellent principles which they exemplify they carry strong marks of the haste and still stronger of the inexperience under which they were framed it is but too obvious that in some instances the fundamental principle under consideration has been violated by too great a mixture and even an actual consolidation of the different powers and that in no instance has a competent provision been made for maintaining in practice the separation delineated on paper what i have wished to evince is that the charge brought against the proposed constitution of violating the sacred maxim of free government is warranted neither by the real meaning annexed to that maxim by its author nor by the sense in which it has hitherto been understood in america this interesting subject will be resumed in the ensuing paper it was shown in the last paper that the political apothegm there examined does not require that the legislative executive and judiciary departments should be wholly unconnected with each other i shall undertake in the next place to show that unless these departments be so far connected and blended as to give to each a constitutional control over the others the degree of separation which the maxim requires as essential to a free government can never in practice be duly maintained it is agreed on all sides that the powers properly belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly and completely administered by either of the other departments it is equally evident that none of them ought to possess directly or indirectly an overruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers it will not be denied that power is of an encroaching nature and that it ought to be effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it after discriminating therefore in theory the several classes of power as they may in their nature be legislative executive or judiciary the next and most difficult task is to provide some practical security for each against the invasion of the others what this security ought to be is the great problem to be solved will it be sufficient to mark with precision the boundaries of these departments in the constitution of the government and to trust to these parchment barriers against the encroaching spirit of power this is the security which appears to have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of the american constitutions but experience assures us that the efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated and that some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the more feeble against the more powerful members of the government the legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex the founders of our republics have so much merit for the wisdom which they have displayed that no task can be less pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have fallen a respect for truth however obliges us to remark that they seem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and allgrasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate supported and fortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority they seem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations which by assembling all power in the same hands must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations in a government where numerous and extensive prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary monarch the executive department is very justly regarded as the source of danger and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty ought to inspire in a democracy where a multitude of people exercise in person the legislative functions and are continually exposed by their incapacity for regular deliberation and concerted measures to the ambitious intrigues of their executive magistrates tyranny may well be apprehended on some favorable emergency to start up in the same quarter but in a representative republic where the executive magistracy is carefully limited both in the extent and the duration of its power and where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly which is inspired by a supposed influence over the people with an intrepid confidence in its own strength which is sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a multitude yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions by means which reason prescribes it is against the enterprising ambition of this department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their precautions the legislative department derives a superiority in our governments from other circumstances its constitutional powers being at once more extensive and less susceptible of precise limits it can with the greater facility mask under complicated and indirect measures the encroachments which it makes on the coordinate departments it is not unfrequently a question of real nicety in legislative bodies whether the operation of a particular measure will or will not extend beyond the legislative sphere on the other side the executive power being restrained within a narrower compass and being more simple in its nature and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less uncertain projects of usurpation by either of these departments would immediately betray and defeat themselves nor is this all as the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people and has in some constitutions full discretion and in all a prevailing influence over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments a dependence is thus created in the latter which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former i have appealed to our own experience for the truth of what i advance on this subject were it necessary to verify this experience by particular proofs they might be multiplied without end i might find a witness in every citizen who has shared in or been attentive to the course of public administrations i might collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of every state in the union but as a more concise and at the same time equally satisfactory evidence i will refer to the example of two states attested by two unexceptionable authorities the first example is that of virginia a state which as we have seen has expressly declared in its constitution that the three great departments ought not to be intermixed the authority in support of it is mr jefferson who besides his other advantages for remarking the operation of the government was himself the chief magistrate of it in order to convey fully the ideas with which his experience had impressed him on this subject it will be necessary to quote a passage of some length from his very interesting notes on the state of virginia p 195 all the powers of government legislative executive and judiciary result to the legislative body the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and not by a single one one hundred and seventythree despots would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of venice as little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves an elective despotism was not the government we fought for but one which should not only be founded on free principles but in which the powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits without being effectually checked and restrained by the others for this reason that convention which passed the ordinance of government laid its foundation on this basis that the legislative executive and judiciary departments should be separate and distinct so that no person should exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same time but no barrier was provided between these several powers the judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the legislative for their subsistence in office and some of them for their continuance in it if therefore the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers no opposition is likely to be made nor if made can be effectual because in that case they may put their proceedings into the form of acts of assembly which will render them obligatory on the other branches they have accordingly in many instances decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy and the direction of the executive during the whole time of their session is becoming habitual and familiar the other state which i shall take for an example is pennsylvania and the other authority the council of censors which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784 a part of the duty of this body as marked out by the constitution was to inquire whether the constitution had been preserved inviolate in every part and whether the legislative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians of the people or assumed to themselves or exercised other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the constitution in the execution of this trust the council were necessarily led to a comparison of both the legislative and executive proceedings with the constitutional powers of these departments and from the facts enumerated and to the truth of most of which both sides in the council subscribed it appears that the constitution had been flagrantly violated by the legislature in a variety of important instances a great number of laws had been passed violating without any apparent necessity the rule requiring that all bills of a public nature shall be previously printed for the consideration of the people although this is one of the precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution against improper acts of legislature the constitutional trial by jury had been violated and powers assumed which had not been delegated by the constitution executive powers had been usurped the salaries of the judges which the constitution expressly requires to be fixed had been occasionally varied and cases belonging to the judiciary department frequently drawn within legislative cognizance and determination those who wish to see the several particulars falling under each of these heads may consult the journals of the council which are in print some of them it will be found may be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the war but the greater part of them may be considered as the spontaneous shoots of an illconstituted government it appears also that the executive department had not been innocent of frequent breaches of the constitution there are three observations however which ought to be made on this head first a great proportion of the instances were either immediately produced by the necessities of the war or recommended by congress or the commanderinchief second in most of the other instances they conformed either to the declared or the known sentiments of the legislative department third the executive department of pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the other states by the number of members composing it in this respect it has as much affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive council and being at once exempt from the restraint of an individual responsibility for the acts of the body and deriving confidence from mutual example and joint influence unauthorized measures would of course be more freely hazarded than where the executive department is administered by a single hand or by a few hands the conclusion which i am warranted in drawing from these observations is that a mere demarcation on parchment of the constitutional limits of the several departments is not a sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the same hands the remaining charge against the house of representatives which i am to examine is grounded on a supposition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time as the progress of population may demand it has been admitted that this objection if well supported would have great weight the following observations will show that like most other objections against the constitution it can only proceed from a partial view of the subject or from a jealousy which discolors and disfigures every object which is beheld 1 those who urge the objection seem not to have recollected that the federal constitution will not suffer by a comparison with the state constitutions in the security provided for a gradual augmentation of the number of representatives the number which is to prevail in the first instance is declared to be temporary its duration is limited to the short term of three years within every successive term of ten years a census of inhabitants is to be repeated the unequivocal objects of these regulations are first to readjust from time to time the apportionment of representatives to the number of inhabitants under the single exception that each state shall have one representative at least secondly to augment the number of representatives at the same periods under the sole limitation that the whole number shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand inhabitants if we review the constitutions of the several states we shall find that some of them contain no determinate regulations on this subject that others correspond pretty much on this point with the federal constitution and that the most effectual security in any of them is resolvable into a mere directory provision 2 as far as experience has taken place on this subject a gradual increase of representatives under the state constitutions has at least kept pace with that of the constituents and it appears that the former have been as ready to concur in such measures as the latter have been to call for them 3 there is a peculiarity in the federal constitution which insures a watchful attention in a majority both of the people and of their representatives to a constitutional augmentation of the latter the peculiarity lies in this that one branch of the legislature is a representation of citizens the other of the states in the former consequently the larger states will have most weight in the latter the advantage will be in favor of the smaller states from this circumstance it may with certainty be inferred that the larger states will be strenuous advocates for increasing the number and weight of that part of the legislature in which their influence predominates and it so happens that four only of the largest will have a majority of the whole votes in the house of representatives should the representatives or people therefore of the smaller states oppose at any time a reasonable addition of members a coalition of a very few states will be sufficient to overrule the opposition a coalition which notwithstanding the rivalship and local prejudices which might prevent it on ordinary occasions would not fail to take place when not merely prompted by common interest but justified by equity and the principles of the constitution it may be alleged perhaps that the senate would be prompted by like motives to an adverse coalition and as their concurrence would be indispensable the just and constitutional views of the other branch might be defeated this is the difficulty which has probably created the most serious apprehensions in the jealous friends of a numerous representation fortunately it is among the difficulties which existing only in appearance vanish on a close and accurate inspection the following reflections will if i mistake not be admitted to be conclusive and satisfactory on this point notwithstanding the equal authority which will subsist between the two houses on all legislative subjects except the originating of money bills it cannot be doubted that the house composed of the greater number of members when supported by the more powerful states and speaking the known and determined sense of a majority of the people will have no small advantage in a question depending on the comparative firmness of the two houses this advantage must be increased by the consciousness felt by the same side of being supported in its demands by right by reason and by the constitution and the consciousness on the opposite side of contending against the force of all these solemn considerations it is farther to be considered that in the gradation between the smallest and largest states there are several which though most likely in general to arrange themselves among the former are too little removed in extent and population from the latter to second an opposition to their just and legitimate pretensions hence it is by no means certain that a majority of votes even in the senate would be unfriendly to proper augmentations in the number of representatives it will not be looking too far to add that the senators from all the new states may be gained over to the just views of the house of representatives by an expedient too obvious to be overlooked as these states will for a great length of time advance in population with peculiar rapidity they will be interested in frequent reapportionments of the representatives to the number of inhabitants the large states therefore who will prevail in the house of representatives will have nothing to do but to make reapportionments and augmentations mutually conditions of each other and the senators from all the most growing states will be bound to contend for the latter by the interest which their states will feel in the former these considerations seem to afford ample security on this subject and ought alone to satisfy all the doubts and fears which have been indulged with regard to it admitting however that they should all be insufficient to subdue the unjust policy of the smaller states or their predominant influence in the councils of the senate a constitutional and infallible resource still remains with the larger states by which they will be able at all times to accomplish their just purposes the house of representatives cannot only refuse but they alone can propose the supplies requisite for the support of government they in a word hold the pursethat powerful instrument by which we behold in the history of the british constitution an infant and humble representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance and finally reducing as far as it seems to have wished all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government this power over the purse may in fact be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people for obtaining a redress of every grievance and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure but will not the house of representatives be as much interested as the senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions and will they not therefore be unwilling to stake its existence or its reputation on the pliancy of the senate or if such a trial of firmness between the two branches were hazarded would not the one be as likely first to yield as the other these questions will create no difficulty with those who reflect that in all cases the smaller the number and the more permanent and conspicuous the station of men in power the stronger must be the interest which they will individually feel in whatever concerns the government those who represent the dignity of their country in the eyes of other nations will be particularly sensible to every prospect of public danger or of dishonorable stagnation in public affairs to those causes we are to ascribe the continual triumph of the british house of commons over the other branches of the government whenever the engine of a money bill has been employed an absolute inflexibility on the side of the latter although it could not have failed to involve every department of the state in the general confusion has neither been apprehended nor experienced the utmost degree of firmness that can be displayed by the federal senate or president will not be more than equal to a resistance in which they will be supported by constitutional and patriotic principles in this review of the constitution of the house of representatives i have passed over the circumstances of economy which in the present state of affairs might have had some effect in lessening the temporary number of representatives and a disregard of which would probably have been as rich a theme of declamation against the constitution as has been shown by the smallness of the number proposed i omit also any remarks on the difficulty which might be found under present circumstances in engaging in the federal service a large number of such characters as the people will probably elect one observation however i must be permitted to add on this subject as claiming in my judgment a very serious attention it is that in all legislative assemblies the greater the number composing them may be the fewer will be the men who will in fact direct their proceedings in the first place the more numerous an assembly may be of whatever characters composed the greater is known to be the ascendency of passion over reason in the next place the larger the number the greater will be the proportion of members of limited information and of weak capacities now it is precisely on characters of this description that the eloquence and address of the few are known to act with all their force in the ancient republics where the whole body of the people assembled in person a single orator or an artful statesman was generally seen to rule with as complete a sway as if a sceptre had been placed in his single hand on the same principle the more multitudinous a representative assembly may be rendered the more it will partake of the infirmities incident to collective meetings of the people ignorance will be the dupe of cunning and passion the slave of sophistry and declamation the people can never err more than in supposing that by multiplying their representatives beyond a certain limit they strengthen the barrier against the government of a few experience will forever admonish them that on the contrary after securing a sufficient number for the purposes of safety of local information and of diffusive sympathy with the whole society they will counteract their own views by every addition to their representatives the countenance of the government may become more democratic but the soul that animates it will be more oligarchic the machine will be enlarged but the fewer and often the more secret will be the springs by which its motions are directed as connected with the objection against the number of representatives may properly be here noticed that which has been suggested against the number made competent for legislative business it has been said that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum and in particular cases if not in all more than a majority of a quorum for a decision that some advantages might have resulted from such a precaution cannot be denied it might have been an additional shield to some particular interests and another obstacle generally to hasty and partial measures but these considerations are outweighed by the inconveniences in the opposite scale in all cases where justice or the general good might require new laws to be passed or active measures to be pursued the fundamental principle of free government would be reversed it would be no longer the majority that would rule the power would be transferred to the minority were the defensive privilege limited to particular cases an interested minority might take advantage of it to screen themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal or in particular emergencies to extort unreasonable indulgences lastly it would facilitate and foster the baneful practice of secessions a practice which has shown itself even in states where a majority only is required a practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular government a practice which leads more directly to public convulsions and the ruin of popular governments than any other which has yet been displayed among us
