among the confederacies of antiquity the most considerable was that of the grecian republics associated under the amphictyonic council from the best accounts transmitted of this celebrated institution it bore a very instructive analogy to the present confederation of the american states the members retained the character of independent and sovereign states and had equal votes in the federal council this council had a general authority to propose and resolve whatever it judged necessary for the common welfare of greece to declare and carry on war to decide in the last resort all controversies between the members to fine the aggressing party to employ the whole force of the confederacy against the disobedient to admit new members the amphictyons were the guardians of religion and of the immense riches belonging to the temple of delphos where they had the right of jurisdiction in controversies between the inhabitants and those who came to consult the oracle as a further provision for the efficacy of the federal powers they took an oath mutually to defend and protect the united cities to punish the violators of this oath and to inflict vengeance on sacrilegious despoilers of the temple in theory and upon paper this apparatus of powers seems amply sufficient for all general purposes in several material instances they exceed the powers enumerated in the articles of confederation the amphictyons had in their hands the superstition of the times one of the principal engines by which government was then maintained they had a declared authority to use coercion against refractory cities and were bound by oath to exert this authority on the necessary occasions very different nevertheless was the experiment from the theory the powers like those of the present congress were administered by deputies appointed wholly by the cities in their political capacities and exercised over them in the same capacities hence the weakness the disorders and finally the destruction of the confederacy the more powerful members instead of being kept in awe and subordination tyrannized successively over all the rest athens as we learn from demosthenes was the arbiter of greece seventythree years the lacedaemonians next governed it twentynine years at a subsequent period after the battle of leuctra the thebans had their turn of domination it happened but too often according to plutarch that the deputies of the strongest cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker and that judgment went in favor of the most powerful party even in the midst of defensive and dangerous wars with persia and macedon the members never acted in concert and were more or fewer of them eternally the dupes or the hirelings of the common enemy the intervals of foreign war were filled up by domestic vicissitudes convulsions and carnage after the conclusion of the war with xerxes it appears that the lacedaemonians required that a number of the cities should be turned out of the confederacy for the unfaithful part they had acted the athenians finding that the lacedaemonians would lose fewer partisans by such a measure than themselves and would become masters of the public deliberations vigorously opposed and defeated the attempt this piece of history proves at once the inefficiency of the union the ambition and jealousy of its most powerful members and the dependent and degraded condition of the rest the smaller members though entitled by the theory of their system to revolve in equal pride and majesty around the common center had become in fact satellites of the orbs of primary magnitude had the greeks says the abbe milot been as wise as they were courageous they would have been admonished by experience of the necessity of a closer union and would have availed themselves of the peace which followed their success against the persian arms to establish such a reformation instead of this obvious policy athens and sparta inflated with the victories and the glory they had acquired became first rivals and then enemies and did each other infinitely more mischief than they had suffered from xerxes their mutual jealousies fears hatreds and injuries ended in the celebrated peloponnesian war which itself ended in the ruin and slavery of the athenians who had begun it as a weak government when not at war is ever agitated by internal dissentions so these never fail to bring on fresh calamities from abroad the phocians having ploughed up some consecrated ground belonging to the temple of apollo the amphictyonic council according to the superstition of the age imposed a fine on the sacrilegious offenders the phocians being abetted by athens and sparta refused to submit to the decree the thebans with others of the cities undertook to maintain the authority of the amphictyons and to avenge the violated god the latter being the weaker party invited the assistance of philip of macedon who had secretly fostered the contest philip gladly seized the opportunity of executing the designs he had long planned against the liberties of greece by his intrigues and bribes he won over to his interests the popular leaders of several cities by their influence and votes gained admission into the amphictyonic council and by his arts and his arms made himself master of the confederacy such were the consequences of the fallacious principle on which this interesting establishment was founded had greece says a judicious observer on her fate been united by a stricter confederation and persevered in her union she would never have worn the chains of macedon and might have proved a barrier to the vast projects of rome the achaean league as it is called was another society of grecian republics which supplies us with valuable instruction the union here was far more intimate and its organization much wiser than in the preceding instance it will accordingly appear that though not exempt from a similar catastrophe it by no means equally deserved it the cities composing this league retained their municipal jurisdiction appointed their own officers and enjoyed a perfect equality the senate in which they were represented had the sole and exclusive right of peace and war of sending and receiving ambassadors of entering into treaties and alliances of appointing a chief magistrate or praetor as he was called who commanded their armies and who with the advice and consent of ten of the senators not only administered the government in the recess of the senate but had a great share in its deliberations when assembled according to the primitive constitution there were two praetors associated in the administration but on trial a single one was preferred it appears that the cities had all the same laws and customs the same weights and measures and the same money but how far this effect proceeded from the authority of the federal council is left in uncertainty it is said only that the cities were in a manner compelled to receive the same laws and usages when lacedaemon was brought into the league by philopoemen it was attended with an abolition of the institutions and laws of lycurgus and an adoption of those of the achaeans the amphictyonic confederacy of which she had been a member left her in the full exercise of her government and her legislation this circumstance alone proves a very material difference in the genius of the two systems it is much to be regretted that such imperfect monuments remain of this curious political fabric could its interior structure and regular operation be ascertained it is probable that more light would be thrown by it on the science of federal government than by any of the like experiments with which we are acquainted one important fact seems to be witnessed by all the historians who take notice of achaean affairs it is that as well after the renovation of the league by aratus as before its dissolution by the arts of macedon there was infinitely more of moderation and justice in the administration of its government and less of violence and sedition in the people than were to be found in any of the cities exercising singly all the prerogatives of sovereignty the abbe mably in his observations on greece says that the popular government which was so tempestuous elsewhere caused no disorders in the members of the achaean republic because it was there tempered by the general authority and laws of the confederacy we are not to conclude too hastily however that faction did not in a certain degree agitate the particular cities much less that a due subordination and harmony reigned in the general system the contrary is sufficiently displayed in the vicissitudes and fate of the republic whilst the amphictyonic confederacy remained that of the achaeans which comprehended the less important cities only made little figure on the theatre of greece when the former became a victim to macedon the latter was spared by the policy of philip and alexander under the successors of these princes however a different policy prevailed the arts of division were practiced among the achaeans each city was seduced into a separate interest the union was dissolved some of the cities fell under the tyranny of macedonian garrisons others under that of usurpers springing out of their own confusions shame and oppression erelong awaken their love of liberty a few cities reunited their example was followed by others as opportunities were found of cutting off their tyrants the league soon embraced almost the whole peloponnesus macedon saw its progress but was hindered by internal dissensions from stopping it all greece caught the enthusiasm and seemed ready to unite in one confederacy when the jealousy and envy in sparta and athens of the rising glory of the achaeans threw a fatal damp on the enterprise the dread of the macedonian power induced the league to court the alliance of the kings of egypt and syria who as successors of alexander were rivals of the king of macedon this policy was defeated by cleomenes king of sparta who was led by his ambition to make an unprovoked attack on his neighbors the achaeans and who as an enemy to macedon had interest enough with the egyptian and syrian princes to effect a breach of their engagements with the league the achaeans were now reduced to the dilemma of submitting to cleomenes or of supplicating the aid of macedon its former oppressor the latter expedient was adopted the contests of the greeks always afforded a pleasing opportunity to that powerful neighbor of intermeddling in their affairs a macedonian army quickly appeared cleomenes was vanquished the achaeans soon experienced as often happens that a victorious and powerful ally is but another name for a master all that their most abject compliances could obtain from him was a toleration of the exercise of their laws philip who was now on the throne of macedon soon provoked by his tyrannies fresh combinations among the greeks the achaeans though weakened by internal dissensions and by the revolt of messene one of its members being joined by the aetolians and athenians erected the standard of opposition finding themselves though thus supported unequal to the undertaking they once more had recourse to the dangerous expedient of introducing the succor of foreign arms the romans to whom the invitation was made eagerly embraced it philip was conquered macedon subdued a new crisis ensued to the league dissensions broke out among it members these the romans fostered callicrates and other popular leaders became mercenary instruments for inveigling their countrymen the more effectually to nourish discord and disorder the romans had to the astonishment of those who confided in their sincerity already proclaimed universal liberty1 throughout greece with the same insidious views they now seduced the members from the league by representing to their pride the violation it committed on their sovereignty by these arts this union the last hope of greece the last hope of ancient liberty was torn into pieces and such imbecility and distraction introduced that the arms of rome found little difficulty in completing the ruin which their arts had commenced the achaeans were cut to pieces and achaia loaded with chains under which it is groaning at this hour i have thought it not superfluous to give the outlines of this important portion of history both because it teaches more than one lesson and because as a supplement to the outlines of the achaean constitution it emphatically illustrates the tendency of federal bodies rather to anarchy among the members than to tyranny in the head the examples of ancient confederacies cited in my last paper have not exhausted the source of experimental instruction on this subject there are existing institutions founded on a similar principle which merit particular consideration the first which presents itself is the germanic body in the early ages of christianity germany was occupied by seven distinct nations who had no common chief the franks one of the number having conquered the gauls established the kingdom which has taken its name from them in the ninth century charlemagne its warlike monarch carried his victorious arms in every direction and germany became a part of his vast dominions on the dismemberment which took place under his sons this part was erected into a separate and independent empire charlemagne and his immediate descendants possessed the reality as well as the ensigns and dignity of imperial power but the principal vassals whose fiefs had become hereditary and who composed the national diets which charlemagne had not abolished gradually threw off the yoke and advanced to sovereign jurisdiction and independence the force of imperial sovereignty was insufficient to restrain such powerful dependants or to preserve the unity and tranquillity of the empire the most furious private wars accompanied with every species of calamity were carried on between the different princes and states the imperial authority unable to maintain the public order declined by degrees till it was almost extinct in the anarchy which agitated the long interval between the death of the last emperor of the suabian and the accession of the first emperor of the austrian lines in the eleventh century the emperors enjoyed full sovereignty in the fifteenth they had little more than the symbols and decorations of power out of this feudal system which has itself many of the important features of a confederacy has grown the federal system which constitutes the germanic empire its powers are vested in a diet representing the component members of the confederacy in the emperor who is the executive magistrate with a negative on the decrees of the diet and in the imperial chamber and the aulic council two judiciary tribunals having supreme jurisdiction in controversies which concern the empire or which happen among its members the diet possesses the general power of legislating for the empire of making war and peace contracting alliances assessing quotas of troops and money constructing fortresses regulating coin admitting new members and subjecting disobedient members to the ban of the empire by which the party is degraded from his sovereign rights and his possessions forfeited the members of the confederacy are expressly restricted from entering into compacts prejudicial to the empire from imposing tolls and duties on their mutual intercourse without the consent of the emperor and diet from altering the value of money from doing injustice to one another or from affording assistance or retreat to disturbers of the public peace and the ban is denounced against such as shall violate any of these restrictions the members of the diet as such are subject in all cases to be judged by the emperor and diet and in their private capacities by the aulic council and imperial chamber the prerogatives of the emperor are numerous the most important of them are his exclusive right to make propositions to the diet to negative its resolutions to name ambassadors to confer dignities and titles to fill vacant electorates to found universities to grant privileges not injurious to the states of the empire to receive and apply the public revenues and generally to watch over the public safety in certain cases the electors form a council to him in quality of emperor he possesses no territory within the empire nor receives any revenue for his support but his revenue and dominions in other qualities constitute him one of the most powerful princes in europe from such a parade of constitutional powers in the representatives and head of this confederacy the natural supposition would be that it must form an exception to the general character which belongs to its kindred systems nothing would be further from the reality the fundamental principle on which it rests that the empire is a community of sovereigns that the diet is a representation of sovereigns and that the laws are addressed to sovereigns renders the empire a nerveless body incapable of regulating its own members insecure against external dangers and agitated with unceasing fermentations in its own bowels the history of germany is a history of wars between the emperor and the princes and states of wars among the princes and states themselves of the licentiousness of the strong and the oppression of the weak of foreign intrusions and foreign intrigues of requisitions of men and money disregarded or partially complied with of attempts to enforce them altogether abortive or attended with slaughter and desolation involving the innocent with the guilty of general imbecility confusion and misery in the sixteenth century the emperor with one part of the empire on his side was seen engaged against the other princes and states in one of the conflicts the emperor himself was put to flight and very near being made prisoner by the elector of saxony the late king of prussia was more than once pitted against his imperial sovereign and commonly proved an overmatch for him controversies and wars among the members themselves have been so common that the german annals are crowded with the bloody pages which describe them previous to the peace of westphalia germany was desolated by a war of thirty years in which the emperor with one half of the empire was on one side and sweden with the other half on the opposite side peace was at length negotiated and dictated by foreign powers and the articles of it to which foreign powers are parties made a fundamental part of the germanic constitution if the nation happens on any emergency to be more united by the necessity of selfdefense its situation is still deplorable military preparations must be preceded by so many tedious discussions arising from the jealousies pride separate views and clashing pretensions of sovereign bodies that before the diet can settle the arrangements the enemy are in the field and before the federal troops are ready to take it are retiring into winter quarters the small body of national troops which has been judged necessary in time of peace is defectively kept up badly paid infected with local prejudices and supported by irregular and disproportionate contributions to the treasury the impossibility of maintaining order and dispensing justice among these sovereign subjects produced the experiment of dividing the empire into nine or ten circles or districts of giving them an interior organization and of charging them with the military execution of the laws against delinquent and contumacious members this experiment has only served to demonstrate more fully the radical vice of the constitution each circle is the miniature picture of the deformities of this political monster they either fail to execute their commissions or they do it with all the devastation and carnage of civil war sometimes whole circles are defaulters and then they increase the mischief which they were instituted to remedy we may form some judgment of this scheme of military coercion from a sample given by thuanus in donawerth a free and imperial city of the circle of suabia the abbe de st croix enjoyed certain immunities which had been reserved to him in the exercise of these on some public occasions outrages were committed on him by the people of the city the consequence was that the city was put under the ban of the empire and the duke of bavaria though director of another circle obtained an appointment to enforce it he soon appeared before the city with a corps of ten thousand troops and finding it a fit occasion as he had secretly intended from the beginning to revive an antiquated claim on the pretext that his ancestors had suffered the place to be dismembered from his territory1 he took possession of it in his own name disarmed and punished the inhabitants and reannexed the city to his domains it may be asked perhaps what has so long kept this disjointed machine from falling entirely to pieces the answer is obvious the weakness of most of the members who are unwilling to expose themselves to the mercy of foreign powers the weakness of most of the principal members compared with the formidable powers all around them the vast weight and influence which the emperor derives from his separate and hereditary dominions and the interest he feels in preserving a system with which his family pride is connected and which constitutes him the first prince in europethese causes support a feeble and precarious union whilst the repellant quality incident to the nature of sovereignty and which time continually strengthens prevents any reform whatever founded on a proper consolidation nor is it to be imagined if this obstacle could be surmounted that the neighboring powers would suffer a revolution to take place which would give to the empire the force and preeminence to which it is entitled foreign nations have long considered themselves as interested in the changes made by events in this constitution and have on various occasions betrayed their policy of perpetuating its anarchy and weakness if more direct examples were wanting poland as a government over local sovereigns might not improperly be taken notice of nor could any proof more striking be given of the calamities flowing from such institutions equally unfit for selfgovernment and selfdefense it has long been at the mercy of its powerful neighbors who have lately had the mercy to disburden it of one third of its people and territories the connection among the swiss cantons scarcely amounts to a confederacy though it is sometimes cited as an instance of the stability of such institutions they have no common treasury no common troops even in war no common coin no common judicatory nor any other common mark of sovereignty they are kept together by the peculiarity of their topographical position by their individual weakness and insignificancy by the fear of powerful neighbors to one of which they were formerly subject by the few sources of contention among a people of such simple and homogeneous manners by their joint interest in their dependent possessions by the mutual aid they stand in need of for suppressing insurrections and rebellions an aid expressly stipulated and often required and afforded and by the necessity of some regular and permanent provision for accommodating disputes among the cantons the provision is that the parties at variance shall each choose four judges out of the neutral cantons who in case of disagreement choose an umpire this tribunal under an oath of impartiality pronounces definitive sentence which all the cantons are bound to enforce the competency of this regulation may be estimated by a clause in their treaty of 1683 with victor amadeus of savoy in which he obliges himself to interpose as mediator in disputes between the cantons and to employ force if necessary against the contumacious party so far as the peculiarity of their case will admit of comparison with that of the united states it serves to confirm the principle intended to be established whatever efficacy the union may have had in ordinary cases it appears that the moment a cause of difference sprang up capable of trying its strength it failed the controversies on the subject of religion which in three instances have kindled violent and bloody contests may be said in fact to have severed the league the protestant and catholic cantons have since had their separate diets where all the most important concerns are adjusted and which have left the general diet little other business than to take care of the common bailages that separation had another consequence which merits attention it produced opposite alliances with foreign powers of berne at the head of the protestant association with the united provinces and of luzerne at the head of the catholic association with france the united netherlands are a confederacy of republics or rather of aristocracies of a very remarkable texture yet confirming all the lessons derived from those which we have already reviewed the union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign states and each state or province is a composition of equal and independent cities in all important cases not only the provinces but the cities must be unanimous the sovereignty of the union is represented by the statesgeneral consisting usually of about fifty deputies appointed by the provinces they hold their seats some for life some for six three and one years from two provinces they continue in appointment during pleasure the statesgeneral have authority to enter into treaties and alliances to make war and peace to raise armies and equip fleets to ascertain quotas and demand contributions in all these cases however unanimity and the sanction of their constituents are requisite they have authority to appoint and receive ambassadors to execute treaties and alliances already formed to provide for the collection of duties on imports and exports to regulate the mint with a saving to the provincial rights to govern as sovereigns the dependent territories the provinces are restrained unless with the general consent from entering into foreign treaties from establishing imposts injurious to others or charging their neighbors with higher duties than their own subjects a council of state a chamber of accounts with five colleges of admiralty aid and fortify the federal administration the executive magistrate of the union is the stadtholder who is now an hereditary prince his principal weight and influence in the republic are derived from this independent title from his great patrimonial estates from his family connections with some of the chief potentates of europe and more than all perhaps from his being stadtholder in the several provinces as well as for the union in which provincial quality he has the appointment of town magistrates under certain regulations executes provincial decrees presides when he pleases in the provincial tribunals and has throughout the power of pardon as stadtholder of the union he has however considerable prerogatives in his political capacity he has authority to settle disputes between the provinces when other methods fail to assist at the deliberations of the statesgeneral and at their particular conferences to give audiences to foreign ambassadors and to keep agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts in his military capacity he commands the federal troops provides for garrisons and in general regulates military affairs disposes of all appointments from colonels to ensigns and of the governments and posts of fortified towns in his marine capacity he is admiralgeneral and superintends and directs every thing relative to naval forces and other naval affairs presides in the admiralties in person or by proxy appoints lieutenantadmirals and other officers and establishes councils of war whose sentences are not executed till he approves them his revenue exclusive of his private income amounts to three hundred thousand florins the standing army which he commands consists of about forty thousand men such is the nature of the celebrated belgic confederacy as delineated on parchment what are the characters which practice has stamped upon it imbecility in the government discord among the provinces foreign influence and indignities a precarious existence in peace and peculiar calamities from war it was long ago remarked by grotius that nothing but the hatred of his countrymen to the house of austria kept them from being ruined by the vices of their constitution the union of utrecht says another respectable writer reposes an authority in the statesgeneral seemingly sufficient to secure harmony but the jealousy in each province renders the practice very different from the theory the same instrument says another obliges each province to levy certain contributions but this article never could and probably never will be executed because the inland provinces who have little commerce cannot pay an equal quota in matters of contribution it is the practice to waive the articles of the constitution the danger of delay obliges the consenting provinces to furnish their quotas without waiting for the others and then to obtain reimbursement from the others by deputations which are frequent or otherwise as they can the great wealth and influence of the province of holland enable her to effect both these purposes it has more than once happened that the deficiencies had to be ultimately collected at the point of the bayonet a thing practicable though dreadful in a confederacy where one of the members exceeds in force all the rest and where several of them are too small to meditate resistance but utterly impracticable in one composed of members several of which are equal to each other in strength and resources and equal singly to a vigorous and persevering defense foreign ministers says sir william temple who was himself a foreign minister elude matters taken ad referendum by tampering with the provinces and cities in 1726 the treaty of hanover was delayed by these means a whole year instances of a like nature are numerous and notorious in critical emergencies the statesgeneral are often compelled to overleap their constitutional bounds in 1688 they concluded a treaty of themselves at the risk of their heads the treaty of westphalia in 1648 by which their independence was formerly and finally recognized was concluded without the consent of zealand even as recently as the last treaty of peace with great britain the constitutional principle of unanimity was departed from a weak constitution must necessarily terminate in dissolution for want of proper powers or the usurpation of powers requisite for the public safety whether the usurpation when once begun will stop at the salutary point or go forward to the dangerous extreme must depend on the contingencies of the moment tyranny has perhaps oftener grown out of the assumptions of power called for on pressing exigencies by a defective constitution than out of the full exercise of the largest constitutional authorities notwithstanding the calamities produced by the stadtholdership it has been supposed that without his influence in the individual provinces the causes of anarchy manifest in the confederacy would long ago have dissolved it under such a government says the abbe mably the union could never have subsisted if the provinces had not a spring within themselves capable of quickening their tardiness and compelling them to the same way of thinking this spring is the stadtholder it is remarked by sir william temple that in the intermissions of the stadtholdership holland by her riches and her authority which drew the others into a sort of dependence supplied the place these are not the only circumstances which have controlled the tendency to anarchy and dissolution the surrounding powers impose an absolute necessity of union to a certain degree at the same time that they nourish by their intrigues the constitutional vices which keep the republic in some degree always at their mercy the true patriots have long bewailed the fatal tendency of these vices and have made no less than four regular experiments by extraordinary assemblies convened for the special purpose to apply a remedy as many times has their laudable zeal found it impossible to unite the public councils in reforming the known the acknowledged the fatal evils of the existing constitution let us pause my fellowcitizens for one moment over this melancholy and monitory lesson of history and with the tear that drops for the calamities brought on mankind by their adverse opinions and selfish passions let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to heaven for the propitious concord which has distinguished the consultations for our political happiness a design was also conceived of establishing a general tax to be administered by the federal authority this also had its adversaries and failed this unhappy people seem to be now suffering from popular convulsions from dissensions among the states and from the actual invasion of foreign arms the crisis of their destiny all nations have their eyes fixed on the awful spectacle the first wish prompted by humanity is that this severe trial may issue in such a revolution of their government as will establish their union and render it the parent of tranquillity freedom and happiness the next that the asylum under which we trust the enjoyment of these blessings will speedily be secured in this country may receive and console them for the catastrophe of their own i make no apology for having dwelt so long on the contemplation of these federal precedents experience is the oracle of truth and where its responses are unequivocal they ought to be conclusive and sacred the important truth which it unequivocally pronounces in the present case is that a sovereignty over sovereigns a government over governments a legislation for communities as contradistinguished from individuals as it is a solecism in theory so in practice it is subversive of the order and ends of civil polity by substituting violence in place of law or the destructive coercion of the sword in place of the mild and salutary coercion of the magistracy
